## 2.1 Background to the Literature Review

The study of urban growth dynamics through spatio-temporal analysis has evolved significantly over the past four decades, driven by parallel advancements in remote sensing technologies, geographic information systems, and computational modeling techniques. This evolution represents a paradigm shift from simple visual interpretation of aerial photographs to sophisticated machine learning algorithms capable of predicting complex urban expansion patterns with remarkable accuracy.

The foundational period of urban growth analysis (1970s-1990s) was characterized by the pioneering use of satellite remote sensing for land cover mapping. The launch of Landsat 1 in 1972 marked a watershed moment, providing the first systematic, multispectral observations of Earth's surface at moderate spatial resolution (80 meters for the Multispectral Scanner System). Early studies relied heavily on visual interpretation and manual digitization of satellite imagery to detect urban expansion [20]. During this era, researchers established fundamental methodologies for change detection, primarily employing post-classification comparison techniques that involved independently classifying images from different time periods and comparing the results to identify land cover transitions.

The 1990s witnessed significant technological advancements with the launch of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1984, offering improved spatial resolution (30 meters) and enhanced spectral capabilities. This period saw the emergence of digital image processing techniques and the integration of remote sensing with geographic information systems, enabling more sophisticated spatial analysis [7], [9]. Researchers began exploring quantitative approaches to urban growth modeling, with cellular automata emerging as a promising framework for simulating spatial dynamics. The conceptual foundation for CA-based urban models was established during this period, recognizing cities as complex adaptive systems whose evolution could be simulated through local interaction rules [8], [20].

The early 2000s marked a transitional phase characterized by the integration of multiple modeling approaches and the proliferation of freely available satellite data. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), launched in 1999, continued the legacy of moderate-resolution Earth observation, despite the scan line corrector failure in 2003 [2], [15], [17]. This period witnessed the widespread adoption of hybrid modeling frameworks, particularly the integration of cellular automata with Markov chain analysis (CA-Markov), which combined the spatial simulation capabilities of CA with the temporal transition probability matrices of Markov chains [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The SLEUTH model, developed by Keith Clarke, gained prominence as a sophisticated urban growth simulation tool incorporating multiple growth parameters including slope resistance, land use constraints, exclusion factors, urbanization probability, transportation influence, and hillshade effects [8], [23].

The period from 2010 to 2018 represented a significant advancement in both data availability and analytical sophistication. The launch of Landsat 8 in 2013, with its Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), provided enhanced radiometric resolution (12-bit versus 8-bit) and improved signal-to-noise ratios [1], [7], [10], [13], [15]. Concurrently, the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 mission, initiated in 2015, revolutionized urban monitoring by offering high spatial resolution (10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands), short revisit times (5 days with both satellites), and free data access [3], [6], [11]. This era witnessed the integration of machine learning algorithms into urban growth analysis, with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) becoming standard tools for land cover classification [2], [6], [10], [17].

The integration of artificial neural networks with cellular automata (CA-ANN) emerged as a powerful hybrid approach during this period, leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks to derive more realistic transition rules for CA models [1], [4], [7], [9], [14], [21], [30]. These models demonstrated superior performance in capturing non-linear relationships between urban growth drivers and land use transitions, achieving validation accuracies exceeding 90% in many applications [9], [10].

The most recent period (2019-2025) has been characterized by the emergence of deep learning approaches and cloud-based geospatial analysis platforms. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have been applied to urban growth prediction, offering enhanced capabilities for capturing spatial patterns and temporal dependencies [5], [11], [19]. The Google Earth Engine platform has democratized access to petabyte-scale satellite imagery archives and cloud computing resources, enabling researchers to conduct large-scale, multi-temporal analyses that were previously computationally prohibitive [2], [6]. Contemporary studies increasingly employ ensemble approaches that combine multiple algorithms to improve prediction robustness, with hybrid models integrating CA, ANN, Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) becoming commonplace [9], [12], [24].

The evolution of remote sensing sensors has been equally transformative. Beyond the Landsat series, researchers have incorporated data from diverse platforms including SPOT (Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre) satellites offering high spatial resolution, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) providing daily global coverage for rapid change detection, and commercial high-resolution satellites such as QuickBird, IKONOS, and WorldView series for detailed urban feature extraction [8]. The integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 has added all-weather, day-night observation capabilities, particularly valuable for monitoring urban expansion in cloud-prone tropical regions.

Methodologically, the field has progressed from simple binary change/no-change detection to sophisticated multi-class transition modeling capable of predicting not only where urbanization will occur but also the specific types of land use transitions. The incorporation of spatial variables such as proximity to roads, central business districts, water bodies, and topographic factors (slope, elevation) has enhanced model realism by accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of urban growth drivers [3], [10], [14], [20]. Contemporary frameworks increasingly integrate urban growth modeling with sustainability assessments, linking land use change projections to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), urban heat island effects, flood risk, and ecosystem service degradation [4], [13].

The temporal scope of urban growth studies has also expanded dramatically. While early studies typically analyzed decadal changes, contemporary research routinely examines multi-decadal time series spanning 30-50 years and projects future scenarios 20-30 years forward [1], [4], [7], [15], [20], [23]. This extended temporal perspective enables more robust calibration of dynamic models and provides policymakers with long-term strategic planning insights.

Despite these remarkable advances, the field continues to grapple with fundamental challenges including data quality and availability in developing regions, computational complexity of sophisticated models, uncertainty quantification in long-term predictions, and the integration of socioeconomic drivers with biophysical factors. The literature reveals an ongoing tension between model complexity and interpretability, with increasingly sophisticated algorithms sometimes functioning as "black boxes" that obscure the underlying processes driving urban expansion. Nevertheless, the trajectory of research clearly indicates a convergence toward integrated, multi-scale, multi-temporal frameworks that combine the strengths of remote sensing, GIS, and advanced computational modeling to support evidence-based urban planning and sustainable development.

## 2.2 Review of Related Literature

### 2.2.1 Remote Sensing Data and Sensors for Urban Growth Analysis

Remote sensing has emerged as an indispensable tool for monitoring and analyzing urban growth dynamics, providing synoptic, repetitive, and cost-effective observations of land surface changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The selection of appropriate remote sensing data sources represents a critical methodological decision that fundamentally influences the accuracy, detail, and temporal resolution of urban growth analyses.

The Landsat program has maintained its position as the cornerstone of urban growth research, primarily due to its unparalleled combination of moderate spatial resolution, multispectral capabilities, temporal depth extending back to 1972, and free data availability. The majority of reviewed studies employed Landsat imagery as their primary or sole data source, with Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI being the most frequently utilized sensors [1], [2], [7], [9], [10], [13], [15], [17], [21], [25], [28], [29], [30]. The 30-meter spatial resolution of Landsat data has proven adequate for mapping urban extent and detecting expansion patterns at city and regional scales, while the seven to eight spectral bands enable effective discrimination between built-up areas, vegetation, water bodies, and bare land.

Research by Singh et al. demonstrated the utility of multi-temporal Landsat data spanning three decades (1989-2020) for analyzing land use/land cover dynamics in Delhi, India, utilizing Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery [15]. Similarly, Mundia and Aniya employed Landsat data from 1976, 1988, 1995, and 2000 to model urban growth in Nairobi, Kenya, demonstrating the value of long-term time series for calibrating dynamic urban growth models [20]. The consistency in sensor characteristics across the Landsat series, despite technological improvements, has facilitated the creation of harmonized multi-decadal datasets essential for understanding long-term urbanization trends.

The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 mission has rapidly gained prominence in urban growth research since its operational deployment in 2015, offering significant advantages over Landsat in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. With 10-meter resolution in visible and near-infrared bands and a 5-day revisit time (using both Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites), Sentinel-2 enables more detailed mapping of urban features and more frequent monitoring of rapid urbanization processes [3], [6], [11]. Chouhan et al. utilized Sentinel-2 data to predict land use/land cover changes in Jaipur, India, demonstrating the sensor's capability to capture fine-scale urban expansion patterns and the conversion of open and green spaces to built-up areas [3]. The study by O'Neill et al. leveraged yearly time series of Sentinel-2-derived binary urban maps to predict future built-up land cover across nine sites in the continental United States, highlighting the value of high-temporal-resolution data for training predictive models [11].

Comparative studies have evaluated the performance of different machine learning algorithms applied to Sentinel-2 versus Landsat data. Woreta et al. employed both Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 imagery to analyze urban expansion in Debark Town, Ethiopia, utilizing Google Earth Engine for preprocessing and Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms for classification [6]. The integration of multiple sensors enabled cross-validation and enhanced confidence in detected changes. Similarly, the study in Herat City, Afghanistan, utilized Landsat 7 and 8 data from 2000 to 2021, comparing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Classification and Regression Trees algorithms, with Random Forest demonstrating superior classification accuracy [2].

Beyond optical sensors, the integration of ancillary geospatial data has become standard practice in contemporary urban growth research. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), particularly from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), are routinely incorporated to account for topographic constraints on urban expansion [4], [10], [13], [21]. Waleed et al. integrated SRTM DEM with Landsat time series to analyze the relationship between urban growth and thermal field variance in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, demonstrating how elevation data enhances understanding of spatial growth patterns [13]. High-resolution imagery from Google Earth has emerged as a valuable source of reference data for training classification algorithms and validating model outputs [2], [6], [10], [15], [21].

The temporal coverage of remote sensing data employed in urban growth studies varies considerably based on research objectives and data availability. Studies focused on rapid urbanization in developing countries often analyze 20-30 year time periods to capture dramatic transformations [1], [2], [4], [7], [9], [15], [17], [21], [30]. For instance, Din et al. analyzed Karachi's urban dynamics from 1990 to 2020 using remotely sensed images, projecting future patterns to 2050 [1]. In contrast, foundational studies establishing long-term urbanization trends have employed time series extending 40-50 years, as demonstrated by Mundia and Aniya's analysis of Nairobi spanning 1976-2000 with projections to 2030 [20].

The spatial resolution of remote sensing data represents a fundamental trade-off between area coverage, temporal frequency, and computational requirements. While Landsat's 30-meter resolution has proven adequate for city-scale analyses, studies of smaller towns or detailed intra-urban patterns increasingly require higher-resolution data. The 10-meter resolution of Sentinel-2 represents a significant improvement, enabling detection of smaller urban patches and more accurate delineation of urban boundaries [3], [6], [11]. However, very high-resolution commercial satellite data (sub-meter to 5-meter resolution) remains underutilized in urban growth modeling research, primarily due to cost constraints and limited temporal archives.

An emerging trend in the literature is the integration of multi-source remote sensing data to leverage complementary strengths of different sensors. Pour et al. utilized Landsat 5 and 8 data to estimate 147 spectral-textural indices for predicting land use/land cover changes in Estonia, demonstrating how derived indices can enhance classification accuracy beyond raw spectral bands [12]. The study by Mumtaz et al. integrated multitemporal Landsat imagery (5, 7, and 8) with SRTM-DEM, historical land use maps, and population data to advance sustainable development goals for coastal urbanization in Karachi [4]. This multi-source integration approach represents a methodological advancement that addresses the limitations of single-sensor analyses.

Cloud computing platforms, particularly Google Earth Engine, have revolutionized the accessibility and processing of large-scale remote sensing datasets. Multiple studies leveraged Google Earth Engine for preprocessing multi-temporal satellite imagery, enabling analyses that would be computationally prohibitive using traditional desktop GIS software [2], [6], [12], [13]. This technological advancement has democratized access to petabyte-scale Earth observation archives, facilitating more comprehensive temporal analyses and enabling researchers in data-scarce regions to conduct sophisticated urban growth studies.

Despite the remarkable progress in remote sensing data availability and quality, significant gaps remain. The literature reveals limited utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for urban growth analysis, despite its all-weather observation capabilities and sensitivity to urban structure. Similarly, hyperspectral remote sensing, which offers hundreds of narrow spectral bands enabling detailed material discrimination, remains largely unexplored in urban growth modeling contexts. The integration of nighttime lights data from sensors such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) for detecting urbanization patterns represents another underutilized data source in the reviewed literature.

### 2.2.2 GIS-Based Spatial Analysis Techniques

Geographic Information Systems have evolved from simple digital mapping tools to sophisticated analytical platforms that enable complex spatial modeling, multi-criteria evaluation, and integration of diverse geospatial datasets. The role of GIS in urban growth research extends far beyond data visualization, encompassing spatial database management, proximity analysis, overlay operations, terrain analysis, and the implementation of dynamic simulation models.

The integration of GIS with remote sensing data forms the methodological backbone of contemporary urban growth research. GIS platforms provide the spatial framework for organizing multi-temporal land cover classifications, deriving spatial variables that influence urban expansion, and implementing cellular automata and other spatially explicit models [1], [8], [18], [20], [22], [29]. Al-shalabi et al. demonstrated the application of GIS-based cellular automata and SLEUTH models for simulating urban growth in Sana'a, Yemen, utilizing geo-statistical techniques within the GIS environment to analyze 35 years of time series data [8]. The study achieved remarkable validation accuracy of 99.6%, underscoring the power of GIS-based spatial modeling when properly calibrated.

Multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) represent widely adopted GIS-based techniques for identifying and weighting factors that drive urban expansion. These approaches enable researchers to systematically integrate multiple spatial variables—including proximity to roads, distance to city centers, slope, elevation, proximity to water bodies, and land use constraints—into composite suitability maps that inform urban growth models [9], [14], [24], [26]. Lawmchullova et al. employed multi-criteria evaluation and analytical hierarchical process to highlight factors influencing unplanned urban growth in Aizawl City, India, achieving model validation accuracies of 97.30% to 100% across different time periods [9]. The AHP method enables expert knowledge and stakeholder preferences to be formally incorporated into spatial models, enhancing their relevance for planning applications.

Proximity analysis represents a fundamental GIS operation extensively employed in urban growth research. The calculation of Euclidean distances or network distances to key urban features—roads, central business districts, existing urban areas, water bodies, and employment centers—provides essential explanatory variables for statistical and machine learning models [3], [10], [14], [20], [26]. Chettry et al. utilized proximity variables in conjunction with an ANN-MLP and CA model to delineate urban growth boundaries in Thiruvananthapuram, India, demonstrating how spatial relationships captured through GIS analysis enhance predictive accuracy [14]. The study revealed that urban expansion was strongly influenced by accessibility factors, with areas closer to existing infrastructure experiencing more rapid development.

Terrain analysis capabilities within GIS platforms enable the derivation of topographic variables that constrain or facilitate urban expansion. Slope, aspect, elevation, and terrain ruggedness indices are routinely calculated from digital elevation models and incorporated as explanatory variables in urban growth models [4], [8], [10], [13], [20], [21], [26]. Fitawok et al. demonstrated that slope variables significantly influenced the spatial pattern of urban expansion in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, with built-up areas preferentially expanding in flatter terrain while steep slopes remained largely undeveloped [26]. The integration of topographic constraints enhances model realism by preventing unrealistic predictions of urban development in physically unsuitable locations.

Network analysis represents another sophisticated GIS capability increasingly employed in urban growth research. Road networks exert profound influence on urban expansion patterns, with development typically following transportation corridors in a process termed "road-influenced growth" [8], [20], [23]. Gandhi et al. utilized the SLEUTH model to predict urban sprawl in Hyderabad, India, finding very high coefficients for spread and road gravity, indicating that the predicted mode of growth was organic edge growth and road-influenced expansion [23]. The incorporation of network distance (as opposed to simple Euclidean distance) provides more realistic measures of accessibility that better explain observed urban growth patterns.

The implementation of cellular automata models within GIS environments represents a significant methodological advancement that has transformed urban growth simulation. CA models divide the study area into a regular grid of cells, with each cell's state (e.g., urban or non-urban) evolving based on transition rules that consider the states of neighboring cells and various spatial drivers [8], [18], [20], [22], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The spatially explicit nature of CA models makes GIS the natural platform for their implementation, with GIS providing the data structures, spatial operators, and visualization capabilities required for CA simulation. Arsanjani et al. employed a spatially explicit Markov Chain based on cellular automata to track dynamic land-use change in Tehran, demonstrating the model's capability to predict forthcoming changes based on past land use patterns [18].

The MOLUSCE (Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation) plugin for QGIS has emerged as a popular open-source tool for implementing CA-based urban growth models [1], [7], [9], [14], [21], [30]. This plugin integrates cellular automata with artificial neural networks and provides a user-friendly interface for model calibration, simulation, and validation. Mazroa et al. utilized the MOLUSCE plugin with CA and ANN-MLP models to forecast urban expansion in Vila Velha, Brazil, projecting that built-up areas would increase from 51.64 km² in 2024 to 62.31 km² in 2034 [30]. The accessibility of such tools has democratized sophisticated urban growth modeling, enabling researchers without extensive programming expertise to implement state-of-the-art simulation frameworks.

Spatial metrics and landscape ecology indices calculated within GIS environments provide quantitative measures of urban form and sprawl patterns. Shannon's entropy index has been widely adopted to quantify the degree of urban sprawl, with higher entropy values indicating more dispersed, fragmented development patterns [2], [14], [30]. Chettry et al. employed Shannon's entropy index to detect urban sprawl in Thiruvananthapuram, finding that the urban agglomeration's spatial expanse increased by 112% between 2001 and 2011, with entropy values confirming a dispersed growth pattern [14]. Other spatial metrics including patch density, edge density, landscape shape index, and aggregation index enable researchers to characterize the morphology of urban expansion and distinguish between compact versus sprawling development patterns.

Buffer analysis and overlay operations represent fundamental GIS techniques employed to analyze the spatial relationships between urban growth and various geographic features. Multiple studies created buffer zones around roads, water bodies, and existing urban areas to examine how proximity influences the probability of land conversion to urban use [10], [14], [20], [26]. These spatial relationships are then quantified and incorporated as explanatory variables in predictive models. The overlay of multiple spatial layers—land use, zoning regulations, environmental constraints, infrastructure networks—enables the identification of areas suitable for future urban development and those requiring protection from urbanization.

The integration of GIS with cloud computing platforms represents an emerging trend that addresses the computational limitations of desktop GIS software when processing large-scale, multi-temporal datasets. Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, has been increasingly adopted for preprocessing satellite imagery, calculating spectral indices, and performing land cover classification [2], [6], [12], [13]. Woreta et al. utilized Google Earth Engine for preprocessing Landsat 7, 8, and Sentinel-2 imagery to analyze urban expansion in Debark Town, Ethiopia, demonstrating how cloud computing enables efficient processing of multi-sensor, multi-temporal datasets [6]. This technological advancement has significantly reduced the time and computational resources required for large-scale urban growth analyses.

Despite these methodological advances, the literature reveals several underutilized GIS capabilities in urban growth research. Three-dimensional GIS analysis, which could provide insights into vertical urban development and building density changes, remains largely unexplored. Similarly, space-time cube analysis and other advanced spatio-temporal visualization techniques that could reveal complex patterns of urban expansion are rarely employed. The integration of real-time or near-real-time data streams, such as mobile phone data, social media check-ins, or traffic patterns, with traditional GIS-based urban growth models represents another frontier that has received limited attention in the reviewed literature.

### 2.2.3 Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection Methods

Land use and land cover change detection constitutes the foundational analytical step in urban growth research, providing the empirical basis for understanding historical urbanization patterns and calibrating predictive models. The accuracy and reliability of change detection directly influence the quality of subsequent modeling efforts, making methodological choices in this domain critically important.

Post-classification comparison represents the most widely adopted change detection approach in the reviewed literature, involving independent classification of images from different time periods followed by pixel-by-pixel or object-by-object comparison to identify land cover transitions [1], [7], [9], [15], [17], [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. This method offers the advantage of providing detailed "from-to" change information, enabling researchers to construct transition matrices that quantify the specific pathways of land cover change. Singh et al. employed supervised maximum likelihood classification on Landsat imagery from 1989, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to detect land use/land cover changes in Delhi, India, revealing that urban and open areas increased by 13.44% and 2.40% respectively, while crop land decreased by 10.88% [15]. The post-classification approach enables straightforward interpretation of results and facilitates the calculation of change statistics for different land cover classes.

The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) has emerged as a popular tool for land use classification and change detection, offering automated workflows for preprocessing, classification, and accuracy assessment [1], [7], [9], [21]. Din et al. utilized the SCP approach for land use classification from 1990 to 2020 in Karachi, Pakistan, identifying approximately 423.75 km² and 856.97 km² of land converted into built-up areas and grasslands respectively [1]. The plugin's integration with QGIS and its support for various classification algorithms make it accessible to researchers with diverse technical backgrounds. Similarly, Lawmchullova et al. employed the land cover change method of the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin to identify past land use/land cover patterns in Aizawl City, India, achieving Kappa coefficients of 97.30% in 1991 and 100% in subsequent years [9].

Supervised classification algorithms, particularly Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), have maintained their position as standard approaches for land cover mapping despite the emergence of more sophisticated machine learning methods [7], [15]. The MLC algorithm assumes that the spectral signatures of each land cover class follow a normal distribution and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to each class based on training data. Roy et al. utilized the maximum likelihood classification algorithm to classify Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images from 1990 to 2020 in Kakinada city, India, revealing rapid urban area increase of 18.02% over the 50-year period [7]. The interpretability and computational efficiency of MLC continue to make it attractive for large-area, multi-temporal analyses.

The advent of machine learning algorithms has significantly enhanced land cover classification accuracy and the ability to handle complex spectral signatures. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) have become standard tools in contemporary urban growth research [2], [6], [10], [17], [25]. These algorithms offer advantages over traditional parametric classifiers by making fewer assumptions about data distributions and effectively handling high-dimensional feature spaces. The study in Herat City, Afghanistan, compared SVM, RF, and CART algorithms for classifying Landsat 7 and 8 imagery from 2000 to 2021, with Random Forest demonstrating higher accuracy and being selected as the classification algorithm [2]. The RF algorithm's ability to handle large numbers of input variables, assess variable importance, and provide estimates of classification uncertainty has made it particularly popular.

Comparative evaluations of classification algorithms provide valuable insights into their relative performance for urban growth applications. Woreta et al. compared Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms for classifying Landsat 7, 8, and Sentinel-2 imagery in Debark Town, Ethiopia, using an 80:20 training-to-testing split for accuracy assessment [6]. The Random Forest model demonstrated high accuracy, achieving 95.86% in 2000 and 97.29% in 2025, outperforming SVM. Such comparative studies help establish best practices and guide methodological choices for future research. However, the literature reveals that algorithm performance is often context-dependent, influenced by factors including landscape complexity, spectral separability of land cover classes, quality and quantity of training data, and sensor characteristics.

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) represents an alternative to pixel-based classification that has gained traction in urban growth research, particularly when using high-resolution imagery. OBIA segments images into homogeneous objects based on spectral and spatial properties before classification, potentially reducing salt-and-pepper noise and enabling incorporation of shape, texture, and contextual information [3]. Chouhan et al. employed object-based detection integrated with machine learning to predict land use/land cover change in Jaipur, India, demonstrating the hybrid approach's strong predictive accuracy [3]. The object-based approach aligns more closely with human visual interpretation and may be particularly advantageous for mapping complex urban environments where individual pixels contain mixed land cover types.

Spectral indices derived from multispectral imagery provide enhanced discrimination of specific land cover types and are routinely incorporated into classification workflows. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and various soil indices enable more accurate separation of vegetation, built-up areas, water bodies, and bare soil [12], [13]. Pour et al. estimated 147 spectral-textural indices from Landsat 5 and 8 data, selecting 19 indices to model land use/land cover changes in Estonia, demonstrating how derived indices can enhance classification accuracy beyond raw spectral bands [12]. The integration of textural features derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) provides additional information about spatial patterns that can improve urban area delineation.

Change detection accuracy assessment represents a critical but often inadequately addressed aspect of urban growth research. The literature reveals considerable variation in validation approaches, with some studies reporting only overall accuracy and Kappa statistics for individual time periods rather than explicitly validating detected changes [1], [7], [9], [15], [21]. More rigorous approaches involve independent validation of change/no-change maps using reference data from high-resolution imagery, field surveys, or historical maps [20], [26]. The Kappa coefficient, despite its widespread use, has been criticized for its dependence on prevalence and its potential to provide misleading assessments of agreement. Contemporary best practices advocate reporting multiple accuracy metrics including producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and class-specific F1 scores to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of classification performance.

Temporal consistency in land cover classifications represents a significant challenge that can introduce spurious changes in multi-temporal analyses. Differences in atmospheric conditions, phenology, sensor calibration, and classification algorithms between time periods can result in apparent land cover changes that reflect methodological artifacts rather than actual landscape transformations. Some studies have addressed this issue through careful image selection (choosing anniversary dates to minimize phenological differences), atmospheric correction, and radiometric normalization [15], [17], [20]. However, the literature reveals that many studies do not explicitly address temporal consistency, potentially introducing uncertainty into change detection results.

The minimum mapping unit and positional accuracy of land cover classifications fundamentally constrain the types of urban changes that can be reliably detected. Landsat's 30-meter spatial resolution limits the detection of small urban patches and narrow linear features such as roads, potentially underestimating the extent of dispersed, low-density urban development [2], [15], [17]. Sentinel-2's improved 10-meter resolution partially addresses this limitation, enabling detection of smaller urban features [3], [6], [11]. However, the literature reveals limited discussion of how spatial resolution influences the characterization of urban growth patterns, particularly the distinction between compact versus sprawling development.

### 2.2.4 Urban Growth Modeling Approaches

Urban growth modeling represents the most methodologically diverse domain within the reviewed literature, encompassing approaches ranging from simple extrapolation of historical trends to sophisticated machine learning algorithms capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships. The evolution of modeling approaches reflects broader trends in computational capabilities, data availability, and theoretical understanding of urban systems as complex adaptive phenomena.

#### Cellular Automata Models

Cellular automata have emerged as the dominant framework for spatially explicit urban growth simulation, appearing in the majority of reviewed studies either as standalone models or integrated with other approaches [1], [7], [8], [9], [14], [18], [20], [21], [22], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. The appeal of CA models stems from their ability to generate complex spatial patterns from simple local interaction rules, their computational efficiency, and their conceptual alignment with theories of urban development as a bottom-up, self-organizing process. CA models divide the study area into a regular grid of cells, with each cell's state evolving based on transition rules that consider the states of neighboring cells (typically using Moore or von Neumann neighborhoods) and various spatial drivers.

The foundational CA model for urban growth simulation was developed by Keith Clarke and colleagues, evolving into the SLEUTH model (Slope, Land use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation, Hillshade) that has been widely applied globally [8], [23]. Al-shalabi et al. applied both CA and SLEUTH models to simulate urban growth in Sana'a, Yemen, finding that the CA model predicted high-density development with less agricultural land, while the SLEUTH model indicated more urban sprawl and low-density development [8]. The SLEUTH model's incorporation of multiple growth types—spontaneous growth, new spreading center growth, edge growth, and road-influenced growth—enables it to capture diverse urbanization patterns. Gandhi et al. utilized SLEUTH to predict urban sprawl in Hyderabad, India, revealing that the predicted mode of growth was organic edge growth and road-influenced growth due to very high coefficients of spread and road gravity, with projections indicating 120% increase in urban growth between 2005 and 2055 [23].

The calibration of CA models represents a significant methodological challenge, requiring the determination of transition rules and parameter values that enable the model to reproduce observed historical changes. Mundia and Aniya employed a multi-stage Monte Carlo method to calibrate the Clarke Urban Growth Model for Nairobi, Kenya, refining parameters including diffusion, breed, spread, slope resistance, and road gravity [20]. The calibration process involved comparing simulated and actual urban extents for multiple time periods, achieving high spatial accuracy of 80% for 1995 and 86% for 2000. The computational intensity of calibration, particularly for models with multiple parameters, has motivated the development of automated calibration procedures and the integration of optimization algorithms.

#### Markov Chain Models

Markov chain analysis provides a complementary approach to urban growth modeling by quantifying the probability of land cover transitions between different states over time. Markov models assume that the probability of a cell transitioning from one land cover class to another depends only on its current state (the Markov property), enabling the calculation of transition probability matrices from historical land cover maps [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. These transition probabilities can then be applied to current land cover to predict future distributions. However, standard Markov models are aspatial, predicting the quantity of change but not its spatial allocation.

The integration of cellular automata with Markov chain analysis (CA-Markov) has become one of the most widely adopted hybrid approaches in urban growth research, combining Markov's temporal transition probabilities with CA's spatial allocation capabilities [15], [18], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Rimal et al. employed a hybrid MC-CA model to predict future urban sprawl in Kathmandu valley, Nepal, finding that urban area increased from 40.53 km² in 1988 to 144.35 km² in 2016 with an average annual growth rate of 9.15%, and projecting continued expansion to 200 km² by 2024 and 238 km² by 2032 [25]. The CA-Markov approach has demonstrated robust performance across diverse geographic contexts, from rapidly urbanizing cities in developing countries to more mature urban systems in developed nations.

Fitawok et al. utilized an integrated CA-MC model to analyze and predict urban expansion in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, employing an Analytical Hierarchy Process to identify biophysical and socioeconomic factors underlying expansion [26]. The study revealed that built-up areas were rapidly expanding at the expense of farmland and vegetation cover, with predictions indicating that conversions of other land use types into built-up areas would persist in the southern, southwestern, and northeastern areas, primarily influenced by road accessibility, proximity to city center, and slope variables. The integration of AHP with CA-Markov enables expert knowledge and stakeholder preferences to be formally incorporated into spatial models, enhancing their relevance for planning applications.

Traore et al. applied CA-Markov to simulate land-cover change in Conakry, Guinea, using Landsat data from 1986, 2000, and 2016 [29]. The model validation using Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) showed very strong agreement between simulated and actual 2016 land cover maps. Predictions for 2025 indicated that urban area would increase from 49% in 2016 to 52%, while vegetation would decrease from 35% to 32%. The study attributed rapid land-cover change to population growth and rural poverty driving migration to the capital. Wang et al. employed CA-Markov to detect and predict land use change in Thimphu, Bhutan, revealing a significant increase of 12.77% in built-up area from 2002 to 2018, with predictions showing built-up area consuming 73.21% of the city by 2050 under business-as-usual scenarios [27].

The Land Change Modeler (LCM) module of TerrSet software, which implements a CA-Markov process, has been employed in several studies for future urban growth prediction [15]. Singh et al. utilized LCM to predict urban growth in Delhi and its environs, achieving 98.63% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.96 for 2030 predictions, with results indicating a 24.30% increase in urban area [15]. The LCM provides an integrated workflow for change analysis, transition potential modeling, and change prediction, making sophisticated CA-Markov modeling accessible to researchers without extensive programming expertise.

#### Machine Learning Approaches

Machine learning algorithms have increasingly been integrated into urban growth modeling, offering enhanced capabilities for capturing non-linear relationships between urban expansion and its drivers. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), have been widely adopted for deriving transition rules in CA models, resulting in CA-ANN hybrid frameworks [1], [4], [7], [9], [10], [14], [21], [30]. ANNs excel at pattern recognition and can learn complex relationships from training data without requiring explicit specification of functional forms.

The MOLUSCE plugin for QGIS, which implements CA-ANN models, has become a popular tool for urban growth simulation [1], [7], [9], [14], [21], [30]. Din et al. utilized the MOLUSCE-based CA-ANN model to simulate future land use patterns in Karachi, Pakistan, from 2020 to 2050, predicting an additional increase of 561.93 km² in built-up areas [1]. The CA-ANN approach demonstrated strong predictive capability, with the neural network component learning the relationships between spatial drivers (proximity to roads, existing urban areas, slope, etc.) and observed urban expansion patterns. Chettry et al. employed ANN-MLP and CA models to delineate urban growth boundaries in Thiruvananthapuram, India, predicting that built-up areas would increase from 140.69 km² in 2017 to 173.31 km² by 2027 [14].

Wecky developed a novel machine learning model incorporating linear regression, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, and AdaBoost to predict urban growth boundaries in Nasiriyah City, Iraq [10]. The study employed supervised classification using Random Forest for land cover mapping and a hybrid ANN-CA method for urban growth prediction. The ANN-CA model achieved an overall kappa value of 90.3% and 80.2% for simulated maps, while the machine learning model for predicting urban growth boundaries achieved R² values ranging from 88% to 100%. This multi-algorithm ensemble approach demonstrated that combining multiple machine learning techniques can enhance prediction robustness and provide uncertainty estimates.

Random Forest algorithms have been employed not only for land cover classification but also for modeling the relationships between urban growth and its drivers [2], [6], [10], [17]. The RF algorithm's ability to handle large numbers of predictor variables, assess variable importance, and provide estimates of prediction uncertainty makes it particularly suitable for urban growth applications where multiple interacting factors influence expansion patterns. The study in Herat City, Afghanistan, employed Random Forest for classification and quantified urban sprawl using Shannon's entropy, revealing that built-up areas increased by 30.06% from 2000 to 2021, with internal migration and inadequate rural amenities identified as primary drivers [2].

Support Vector Machines have been integrated with cellular automata to create hybrid CA-SVM models for urban growth prediction [3]. Chouhan et al. employed a CA-SVM hybrid approach to predict land use/land cover change in Jaipur, India, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy [3]. The SVM component learned the non-linear decision boundaries separating urban from non-urban areas based on spatial variables including proximity to roads, central business districts, drainage, and slope. The integration of SVM with CA enabled both accurate prediction of urbanization probability and realistic spatial allocation of predicted changes.

#### Deep Learning and Advanced Neural Network Approaches

The most recent frontier in urban growth modeling involves the application of deep learning architectures, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These approaches offer enhanced capabilities for capturing spatial patterns and temporal dependencies in urban expansion [5], [11], [19]. O'Neill et al. evaluated six methods for predicting future built-up expansion, including Cellular Automata, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, CNNs, and CNNs with LSTM (ConvLSTM) [11]. The study found that CNNs were the best-performing method, achieving an average Cohen's kappa score of 0.73 across nine study sites in the continental United States. The CNN's ability to automatically learn hierarchical spatial features from input data without manual feature engineering represents a significant advantage over traditional approaches.

Villella et al. developed a novel deep learning prospective urban growth model applied to multispectral satellite data over Córdoba, Argentina [5]. The deep learning model effectively replicated edge expansion by utilizing neighborhood information and accurately simulated outlying growth via isolated patches, following patterns observed in the past. The integration of multispectral remote sensing data and open-source GIS data within the deep learning framework enabled the model to capture complex spatial patterns that simpler models might miss.

Yaagoubi et al. conducted a comparative analysis of CA-Markov versus ConvLSTM models for forecasting urban growth using Sentinel 2A images in Kuwait [19]. The ConvLSTM architecture combines the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the temporal sequence modeling of LSTM networks, potentially offering superior performance for multi-temporal urban growth prediction. However, the study's findings regarding relative performance are not detailed in the available metadata, highlighting a need for more comprehensive comparative evaluations of deep learning versus traditional approaches.

#### Hybrid and Integrated Models

The trend toward hybrid modeling frameworks that integrate multiple approaches represents a significant advancement in urban growth research. These integrated models attempt to leverage the complementary strengths of different techniques while mitigating their individual limitations [12], [24]. Pour et al. employed a hybrid ANN-CA-MCA model for simulating land use/land cover changes and urban expansion in Estonia, utilizing 19 selected spectral-textural indices to model LULC changes [12]. The hybrid model predicted that artificial surfaces would increase by 1.33% to 787.04 km² by 2030, with forest lands decreasing by 34.57 km² while agricultural lands increased by 14.90 km².

The integration of Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with CA and ANN represents another hybrid approach that enables systematic incorporation of multiple spatial factors and expert knowledge [9], [24]. Lawmchullova et al. employed CA-ANN with multi-criteria evaluation and analytical hierarchical process to predict future scenarios in Aizawl City, India, achieving exceptional validation accuracies [9]. The MCE component enabled the weighting of different factors influencing urban growth based on expert judgment, while the ANN learned the complex relationships from historical data, and the CA component allocated changes spatially.

Mostafa et al. employed a logistic regression-Markov chain model to simulate land use/land cover changes in Gharbia Governorate, Egypt, by 2033 and 2048 [17]. The study also utilized the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique to produce an Urbanization Risk Map identifying districts most susceptible to urbanization impacts. The integration of fuzzy logic with traditional modeling approaches enables handling of uncertainty and imprecision in spatial data and expert judgments. The study revealed strong negative correlations between cultivated land changes and built-up cover changes, with R² values of 0.73 and 0.99 for different periods.

Despite the proliferation of sophisticated modeling approaches, the literature reveals ongoing debates about model complexity versus interpretability, computational efficiency versus accuracy, and the relative importance of model structure versus data quality. Simpler models with fewer parameters may be more robust and easier to calibrate, while complex models with many parameters may overfit historical data and perform poorly when extrapolating to future conditions. The optimal modeling approach appears to be context-dependent, influenced by factors including data availability, study area characteristics, prediction time horizon, and intended application of results.

### 2.2.5 Spatio-Temporal Analysis Frameworks

Spatio-temporal analysis frameworks provide the conceptual and methodological structure for integrating spatial and temporal dimensions of urban growth, enabling researchers to not only map where urbanization has occurred but also understand when, how fast, and in what patterns expansion has proceeded. These frameworks bridge the gap between static land cover mapping and dynamic process modeling, offering insights into the trajectories and drivers of urban change.

The temporal resolution of urban growth analyses varies considerably across the reviewed literature, ranging from annual time steps to decadal intervals. Studies employing annual or near-annual observations enable detection of rapid urbanization pulses and provide more data points for model calibration [11], [25]. O'Neill et al. utilized yearly time series of satellite-derived binary urban maps to predict future built-up land cover, arguing that annual observations provide richer temporal information for training predictive models [11]. In contrast, many studies employ decadal time steps (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020), which may miss important inter-decadal variations but reduce data processing requirements and are often constrained by historical data availability [1], [7], [15], [20], [21].

The concept of urban growth trajectories recognizes that cities do not expand uniformly over time but exhibit periods of rapid growth, stagnation, and sometimes contraction. Several studies have quantified temporal variations in urbanization rates, revealing important insights into the drivers and dynamics of urban expansion [2], [6], [7], [20], [25]. The study in Herat City, Afghanistan, found that the city experienced high-speed expansion from 2000-2013 and medium-speed growth from 2013-2021, reflecting changing socioeconomic conditions and policy environments [2]. Woreta et al. documented that urban land in Debark Town, Ethiopia, increased at a rate of 78.46 hectares per year from 2000 to 2025, with the rate of expansion varying across different sub-periods [6]. Understanding these temporal variations is crucial for projecting future growth and identifying the factors that accelerate or decelerate urbanization.

Spatial patterns of urban growth have been characterized using various typologies, including infill development, edge expansion, leapfrog development, and linear growth along transportation corridors [8], [20], [23], [26]. These growth types reflect different underlying processes and have distinct implications for urban form, infrastructure provision, and environmental impacts. Mundia and Aniya found that Nairobi's urban growth was primarily sprawled expansion driven by road networks and population increase, with growth mainly expanding northeast, southeast, and northwest [20]. Gandhi et al. identified organic edge growth and road-influenced growth as the dominant patterns in Hyderabad, India [23]. The ability to distinguish between different growth types enables more nuanced understanding of urbanization processes and more targeted policy interventions.

Directional analysis of urban expansion provides insights into the spatial anisotropy of growth, revealing whether cities expand uniformly in all directions or exhibit preferential growth along certain axes [7], [21], [24]. Ahmad et al. observed that the majority of Lahore's urban area expansion occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions from 2000 to 2020 [21]. Such directional patterns often reflect the influence of topographic constraints, transportation networks, administrative boundaries, and the location of employment centers. Distance-directional growth analysis, as employed in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area study, showed that areas closer to central locations are expected to reach saturation while fringe areas are expected to register higher urban growth [24].

The integration of urban growth analysis with sustainability assessments represents an emerging framework that links land use change to broader environmental and social outcomes [4], [13], [27]. Mumtaz et al. innovatively integrated land use/land cover analysis with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) metrics for Karachi, Pakistan, finding varied SDG progress including 26% for SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) but challenges for SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) [4]. The study projected that 66.65% of urbanized areas could be potentially inundated by 2035, highlighting flood risk as a critical concern. Waleed et al. leveraged remote sensing, machine learning, and geo-information modeling to explore and predict thermal field variance in response to urban growth in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, finding that land surface temperature increased by 0.88°C in summer and approximately 5°C in winter between 1990 and 2020 [13]. These integrated frameworks demonstrate how urban growth analysis can inform broader sustainability planning.

Scenario-based modeling represents another important spatio-temporal framework that enables exploration of alternative urban futures under different assumptions about policies, economic conditions, or environmental constraints [8], [22], [27]. Wang et al. employed business-as-usual scenarios to project that built-up area in Thimphu, Bhutan, would consume 73.21% of the city by 2050, with forest significantly reduced to patches making up only 16% [27]. Such scenario analyses can inform policy debates by quantifying the long-term consequences of current trends and evaluating the potential effectiveness of different interventions. However, the literature reveals that most studies employ single-scenario projections based on continuation of historical trends, with limited exploration of alternative futures.

The temporal extent of projections varies considerably, with some studies forecasting 10-15 years into the future while others project 30-50 years ahead [1], [4], [8], [10], [15], [17], [20], [23], [27]. Longer projection horizons provide strategic planning insights but are subject to greater uncertainty due to potential changes in drivers, policies, and technologies. Din et al. projected Karachi's urban growth from 2020 to 2050, a 30-year horizon that aligns with typical urban master planning timeframes [1]. Gandhi et al. projected Hyderabad's urban growth to 2055, a 50-year horizon that revealed a predicted 120% increase in urban growth [23]. The appropriate projection horizon depends on the intended application, with strategic regional planning requiring longer horizons while tactical local planning may focus on nearer-term projections.

Multi-scale spatio-temporal frameworks recognize that urban growth processes operate at multiple spatial scales, from neighborhood-level infill to regional-scale expansion, and that these scales interact in complex ways. However, the reviewed literature reveals limited explicit treatment of scale interactions, with most studies focusing on a single spatial scale (typically city or metropolitan region). The integration of fine-scale process models with regional-scale strategic models represents an important frontier for future research.

### 2.2.6 Case Studies from Different Geographical Regions

The reviewed literature encompasses urban growth studies from diverse geographical contexts, providing insights into how urbanization processes vary across different regions, development levels, and environmental settings. This geographical diversity enables identification of universal patterns as well as context-specific factors that influence urban expansion.

South Asian cities dominate the reviewed literature, reflecting the region's rapid urbanization and the concentration of remote sensing and GIS research capacity in countries including India, Pakistan, and Nepal [1], [4], [7], [9], [10], [13], [14], [15], [21], [23], [24]. These studies document dramatic urban transformations, with many cities experiencing annual growth rates exceeding 5-10% and urban area doubling or tripling over 20-30 year periods. Din et al. analyzed Karachi, Pakistan, finding that approximately 423.75 km² and 856.97 km² of land were converted into built-up areas and grasslands respectively from 1990 to 2020 [1]. Mumtaz et al. examined the same city from a sustainability perspective, revealing that urban expansion increased from 13.4% to 23.7% between 1990 and 2020 [4]. The concentration of multiple studies on the same city (Karachi) enables cross-validation of findings and assessment of methodological differences.

Indian cities feature prominently in the literature, with studies examining diverse urban contexts from megacities like Delhi and Hyderabad to smaller cities like Kakinada, Thiruvananthapuram, Aizawl, Debark, and Nasiriyah [7], [9], [14], [15], [23], [24]. Singh et al. analyzed Delhi and its environs from 1989 to 2020, finding that urban and open areas increased by 13.44% and 2.40% respectively while crop land decreased by 10.88% [15]. The study projected a 24.30% increase in urban area by 2030, highlighting the ongoing pressure on agricultural lands surrounding major Indian cities. Roy et al. examined Kakinada city, Andhra Pradesh, revealing rapid urban area increase of 18.02% from 1990 to 2040, primarily at the cost of vegetation and wetlands [7]. These studies collectively document the environmental costs of rapid urbanization in South Asia, including loss of agricultural land, vegetation, and wetlands.

African cities, while less represented in the literature, provide important insights into urbanization in contexts characterized by rapid population growth, limited planning capacity, and data scarcity [2], [6], [20], [26], [29]. Mundia and Aniya's foundational study of Nairobi, Kenya, documented urban area expansion from 14 km² in 1976 to 62 km² in 2000, with forested land decreasing significantly by 77 km² [20]. The study projected continued sprawled urban growth driven by road networks and population increase of 4.2% per annum. Fitawok et al. analyzed Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, finding rapid expansion of built-up areas at the expense of farmland and vegetation cover, with predictions indicating continued conversions in southern, southwestern, and northeastern areas [26]. Woreta et al. examined Debark Town, Ethiopia, documenting urban land increase from 4.50% to 15.82% between 2000 and 2025, with agricultural land decreasing from 71.45% to 45.88% [6]. These African case studies highlight the tension between urban development and agricultural land preservation in contexts where food security remains a critical concern.

Middle Eastern and North African cities provide insights into urbanization in arid and semi-arid environments where water scarcity and desert encroachment pose additional constraints [2], [8], [17], [28]. Al-shalabi et al. modeled urban growth in Sana'a, Yemen, comparing CA and SLEUTH models and finding that both predicted continued expansion but with different spatial patterns [8]. Yagoub et al. predicted land cover change in Al-Ain, UAE, from 1992 to 2030, achieving approximately 80% overall accuracy and demonstrating that remote sensing with free Landsat data is viable for prediction in developing countries where data availability is problematic [28]. Mostafa et al. analyzed Gharbia Governorate, Egypt, revealing that agricultural land decreased from 91.2% in 1991 to 83.7% by 2018 due to rapid urbanization, with projections indicating continued decline [17]. These studies document the particular challenges of urban expansion in water-scarce environments where agricultural land is already limited.

Asian cities beyond South Asia provide additional geographical diversity, including studies from Iran, Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Nepal [2], [18], [22], [25], [27]. Arsanjani et al. tracked dynamic land-use change in Tehran using spatially explicit Markov Chain based on cellular automata, demonstrating the model's capability to predict forthcoming changes [18]. Rimal et al. examined Kathmandu valley, Nepal, finding that urban area increased from 40.53 km² in 1988 to 144.35 km² in 2016 with an average annual growth rate of 9.15%, with 91-98% of expanded urban area sourced from cultivated land [25]. Wang et al. analyzed Thimphu, Bhutan, revealing a 12.77% increase in built-up area from 2002 to 2018, with predictions showing built-up area consuming 73.21% of the city by 2050 under business-as-usual scenarios [27]. The Thimphu study is particularly notable for examining urbanization in a high-altitude city, a relatively understudied context.

African cities from West Africa provide insights into urbanization in contexts characterized by extreme poverty and rapid rural-urban migration [29]. Traore et al. analyzed Conakry, Guinea, finding that urban area was 49% in 2016 and expected to increase to 52% by 2025, while vegetation would decrease from 35% to 32% [29]. The study attributed rapid land-cover change to both rapid population growth and extreme poverty in rural areas driving migration to the capital.

South American cities are underrepresented in the reviewed literature, with only two studies examining cities in Argentina and Brazil [5], [30]. Villella et al. developed a deep learning model for the Metropolitan Area of Córdoba, Argentina, projecting urban extent for 2030 [5]. Mazroa et al. analyzed Vila Velha Urban Agglomeration, Brazil, finding that the spatial area increased by 24.36% from 22.98 km² in 1994 to 51.64 km² in 2024, with projections indicating further increase to 62.31 km² by 2034 [30]. The limited representation of South American cities in the literature represents a significant geographical gap.

European cities are notably absent from the reviewed literature, with only one study examining Estonia [12]. Pour et al. analyzed land use/land cover changes and urban expansion in Estonia from 2000-2019, finding that despite an 11% population decrease, agricultural and forest lands became urban, with artificial surfaces predicted to increase by 1.33% to 787.04 km² by 2030 [12]. This study provides a rare example of urbanization in a context of population decline, where urban expansion is driven by factors other than population growth, such as increasing per capita land consumption and changing settlement preferences.

North American cities are represented by a single study examining nine sites in the continental United States [11]. O'Neill et al. evaluated multiple methods for predicting future built-up expansion across these diverse sites, finding that Convolutional Neural Networks achieved the best performance with an average Cohen's kappa score of 0.73 [11]. The limited representation of North American and European cities in the literature likely reflects the fact that these regions have experienced slower urbanization rates in recent decades compared to Asia, Africa, and Latin America, making them less urgent subjects for urban growth research.

The geographical distribution of case studies reveals important patterns and gaps. Rapidly urbanizing cities in developing countries, particularly in South Asia and to a lesser extent Africa, dominate the literature. This concentration reflects both the magnitude of urban change in these regions and the practical importance of understanding and managing rapid urbanization. However, this geographical bias means that the literature provides limited insights into urbanization processes in developed countries, slow-growth contexts, shrinking cities, and certain regions including Europe, North America, Oceania, and much of Latin America. The underrepresentation of small and medium-sized cities relative to large metropolitan areas represents another geographical gap, despite the fact that much of global urban population growth is occurring in smaller urban centers.

### 2.2.7 Accuracy Assessment and Validation Methods

Accuracy assessment and validation represent critical components of urban growth research, providing the empirical basis for evaluating model performance, comparing alternative approaches, and establishing confidence in predictions. The rigor and comprehensiveness of validation methods vary considerably across the reviewed literature, reflecting different research objectives, data availability, and methodological traditions.

The Kappa coefficient has emerged as the most widely reported accuracy metric in urban growth research, appearing in the majority of reviewed studies [1], [7], [9], [10], [11], [15], [24], [25]. The Kappa statistic measures the agreement between predicted and observed land cover classifications while accounting for agreement that would occur by chance alone. Values range from -1 to +1, with values above 0.80 generally considered to indicate strong agreement. Lawmchullova et al. achieved Kappa coefficients of 97.30% in 1991 and 100% in 2001, 2011, and 2021 for their CA-ANN model of Aizawl City, India [9]. Singh et al. reported a kappa coefficient of 0.96 for their 2030 predictions of Delhi's urban growth [15]. However, the Kappa coefficient has been criticized for its dependence on prevalence (the proportion of the study area in each class) and its potential to provide misleading assessments when class distributions are imbalanced.

Overall accuracy, calculated as the percentage of correctly classified pixels, represents another standard metric reported in most studies [2], [6], [8], [9], [13], [15], [20], [28]. Al-shalabi et al. achieved overall accuracy of 99.6% for their CA and SLEUTH models of Sana'a, Yemen [8]. Woreta et al. reported Random Forest model accuracy of 95.86% in 2000 and 97.29% in 2025 for Debark Town, Ethiopia [6]. Waleed et al. achieved over 0.91 overall accuracy and 0.89 Kappa for their land use/land cover classification in Bahawalpur, Pakistan [13]. While overall accuracy provides an intuitive measure of classification performance, it can be misleading when class distributions are imbalanced, as high overall accuracy can be achieved by correctly classifying the dominant class while performing poorly on minority classes.

Producer's accuracy and user's accuracy provide class-specific measures that reveal the performance of classification for individual land cover types. Producer's accuracy (also called recall or sensitivity) measures the proportion of reference pixels of a given class that are correctly classified, while user's accuracy (also called precision) measures the proportion of pixels classified as a given class that actually belong to that class in the reference data. Al-shalabi et al. reported producer's accuracy of 83.3% and user's accuracy of 83.6% for their urban growth models [8]. These class-specific metrics are particularly important in urban growth research where the urban class is often a minority class, and overall accuracy might mask poor performance in detecting urban expansion.

The F1 score, which represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a single metric that balances producer's and user's accuracy. However, the F1 score is rarely reported in the reviewed urban growth literature, representing a methodological gap. Contemporary best practices in remote sensing advocate reporting multiple accuracy metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation of classification performance.

Confusion matrices (also called error matrices) provide detailed information about the types of classification errors, revealing which land cover classes are being confused with one another. While confusion matrices are fundamental to accuracy assessment, many reviewed studies report only summary statistics (overall accuracy and Kappa) without presenting the full confusion matrix, limiting the ability to understand specific sources of error.

Spatial accuracy assessment represents a more sophisticated approach that evaluates not only whether the correct amount of urban growth is predicted but also whether it occurs in the correct locations. Several studies employed pixel-by-pixel comparison of simulated and actual land cover maps to assess spatial accuracy [8], [20], [26]. Mundia and Aniya reported spatial accuracy of 80% for 1995 and 86% for 2000 when comparing simulated and actual urban extents in Nairobi [20]. However, pixel-by-pixel comparison can be overly strict, penalizing predictions that are spatially close but not exactly coincident with observed changes. Fuzzy accuracy assessment methods that account for positional uncertainty have been proposed but are rarely employed in the reviewed literature.

The Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) has been employed in several studies to validate model predictions [29]. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) providing a single measure of model performance. Traore et al. used ROC to validate their CA-Markov model for Conakry, Guinea, finding very strong agreement between simulated and actual 2016 land cover maps [29]. The ROC approach is particularly useful when predictions are probabilistic rather than categorical, as it evaluates performance across the full range of probability thresholds.

Multiple performance metrics beyond traditional accuracy measures have been employed in some studies to provide more comprehensive model evaluation [24]. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area study employed Kappa, Probability of Detection, False Alarm Ratio, Critical Success Index, and Accuracy Score to assess model outputs, finding that while AHP-based CA-MC performed better overall, relying on any one performance metric alone could provide misleading conclusions [24]. This multi-metric approach represents best practice, as different metrics capture different aspects of model performance and may lead to different conclusions about relative model quality.

Temporal validation, which involves calibrating models on early time periods and validating on later periods, provides a more rigorous test of predictive capability than simple accuracy assessment of land cover classifications [10], [15], [20], [26]. Wecky employed this approach in Nasiriyah City, Iraq, calibrating the ANN-CA model on 1992-2012 data and validating on 2022 data, achieving overall kappa values of 90.3% and 80.2% for simulated maps [10]. This temporal split-sample validation provides stronger evidence of model generalizability than validation on the same time period used for calibration.

Cross-validation approaches, which involve partitioning data into training and testing subsets, have been employed in some machine learning-based studies [6]. Woreta et al. used an 80:20 training-to-testing split for accuracy assessment of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms [6]. This approach helps prevent overfitting and provides more realistic estimates of model performance on independent data.

Quantitative comparison of predicted versus observed quantities of change provides another validation approach [17], [25], [26], [29]. Studies report the predicted and actual areas of different land cover classes, enabling assessment of whether models accurately predict the magnitude of urban expansion even if spatial allocation is imperfect. Rimal et al. compared predicted and observed urban areas for multiple time periods in Kathmandu valley, demonstrating that the MC-CA model accurately captured the overall rate of urban expansion [25].

Visual comparison of simulated and actual land cover maps provides qualitative validation that can reveal spatial patterns of agreement and disagreement not captured by quantitative metrics. Many studies include map figures showing predicted versus actual land cover, enabling readers to assess the spatial realism of predictions. However, visual comparison is subjective and does not provide quantitative measures of agreement.

Independent validation using reference data not used in model calibration represents the gold standard for accuracy assessment but is rarely achieved in practice due to data limitations. Most studies use the same land cover classifications for both model calibration and validation, potentially leading to overly optimistic accuracy estimates. The use of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth or other sources as independent reference data for validation represents best practice but is employed in only a subset of reviewed studies [2], [6], [10], [15], [21].

Uncertainty quantification in urban growth predictions remains an underdeveloped area in the reviewed literature. Most studies report point predictions without confidence intervals or probability distributions, despite the inherent uncertainty in long-term projections. Some machine learning approaches, particularly Random Forest, can provide estimates of prediction uncertainty, but these are rarely reported or utilized in urban growth research. The development of ensemble modeling approaches that combine predictions from multiple models could provide more robust uncertainty estimates but has received limited attention in the literature.

The temporal extent of validation varies considerably, with some studies validating only for a single future time period while others validate across multiple time steps [20], [25], [26]. Multi-temporal validation provides stronger evidence of model reliability and enables assessment of whether model performance degrades as the prediction horizon extends further into the future. However, data requirements for multi-temporal validation are substantial, requiring land cover classifications for multiple historical time periods.

### Narrative Synthesis of Research Gaps

The comprehensive review of 30 studies on spatio-temporal analysis and prediction of urban growth using GIS and remote sensing reveals significant advances in methodologies, data sources, and analytical frameworks over the past two decades. However, several critical research gaps emerge from this synthesis, spanning methodological limitations, geographical biases, temporal constraints, data availability issues, and integration challenges.

**Methodological Gaps and Limitations**

A fundamental methodological gap concerns the limited comparative evaluation of different modeling approaches under consistent conditions. While several studies employ multiple algorithms [2], [6], [11], [19], [24], most research applies a single modeling framework without systematic comparison to alternatives. The relative performance of CA-Markov, CA-ANN, SLEUTH, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning approaches remains inadequately characterized across diverse urban contexts. O'Neill et al. provided valuable comparative insights by evaluating six methods across nine US sites, finding CNNs superior [11], but such comprehensive comparisons are rare. Future research should prioritize systematic benchmarking studies that evaluate multiple modeling approaches using standardized datasets and validation protocols.

Uncertainty quantification represents another critical methodological gap. The vast majority of reviewed studies report point predictions without confidence intervals, probability distributions, or sensitivity analyses [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [14], [15], [20], [21], [23], [25], [26], [27], [29], [30]. Long-term urban growth projections extending 20-50 years into the future are inherently uncertain due to potential changes in policies, economic conditions, technologies, and climate. The failure to quantify and communicate this uncertainty limits the utility of predictions for planning applications and may foster false confidence in specific spatial allocations. Ensemble modeling approaches that combine predictions from multiple models could provide more robust uncertainty estimates but have received minimal attention in the urban growth literature.

The integration of socioeconomic drivers with biophysical factors remains superficial in most studies. While research routinely incorporates spatial variables such as proximity to roads, slope, and distance to city centers [3], [10], [14], [20], [26], the explicit modeling of socioeconomic processes—including population dynamics, economic development, policy interventions, and household decision-making—is largely absent. The few studies that mention socioeconomic factors typically treat them as contextual background rather than explicitly modeled variables [2], [9], [17], [27], [29]. This limitation reflects the difficulty of obtaining spatially explicit socioeconomic data and the challenge of integrating social science perspectives with remote sensing and GIS methodologies. Future research should explore agent-based modeling approaches that explicitly represent household and developer decision-making processes.

Validation methodologies exhibit considerable variation in rigor, with many studies relying solely on overall accuracy and Kappa statistics without reporting class-specific metrics, spatial accuracy measures, or conducting temporal split-sample validation [1], [3], [5], [7], [9], [18], [19], [21], [22]. The Kappa coefficient, despite its widespread use, has known limitations including dependence on class prevalence. More rigorous validation approaches employing multiple metrics, independent reference data, and explicit assessment of spatial accuracy are needed [11], [24]. The development of standardized validation protocols would facilitate comparison across studies and enable meta-analyses of model performance.

The treatment of model complexity versus interpretability represents an ongoing tension in the literature. Deep learning approaches offer enhanced predictive accuracy but function as "black boxes" that obscure the underlying processes driving urban expansion [5], [11], [19]. In contrast, simpler models with fewer parameters may be more interpretable and easier to calibrate but may miss important non-linear relationships. The optimal balance between complexity and interpretability likely depends on the intended application, with strategic planning potentially requiring more interpretable models while tactical predictions might prioritize accuracy. However, this trade-off is rarely explicitly discussed in the reviewed literature.

**Geographical Gaps and Biases**

The geographical distribution of case studies reveals pronounced biases toward rapidly urbanizing cities in South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan [1], [4], [7], [9], [10], [13], [14], [15], [21], [23], [24]. While this concentration reflects the magnitude and urgency of urban change in these regions, it results in limited insights into urbanization processes in other contexts. European cities are almost entirely absent from the reviewed literature, with only one study examining Estonia [12]. North American cities are represented by a single multi-site study [11]. South American cities are severely underrepresented [5], [30]. African cities, while present, constitute a small minority of studies [2], [6], [20], [26], [29]. This geographical bias limits the generalizability of findings and the ability to identify universal versus context-specific patterns of urban growth.

Small and medium-sized cities are underrepresented relative to large metropolitan areas, despite the fact that much of global urban population growth is occurring in smaller urban centers. The majority of reviewed studies examine major cities or metropolitan regions [1], [4], [8], [15], [18], [20], [23], [24], [25], with fewer studies focusing on smaller towns [6], [9], [14]. The dynamics of urban growth in small cities may differ fundamentally from those in large metropolitan areas, with different drivers, patterns, and planning challenges. Future research should prioritize small and medium-sized cities to provide a more balanced understanding of global urbanization.

Shrinking cities and contexts of population decline represent another geographical gap. Only one reviewed study examined urban expansion in a context of population decrease (Estonia), finding that urbanization continued despite an 11% population decline [12]. This counterintuitive finding highlights the importance of per capita land consumption and changing settlement preferences as drivers of urban expansion independent of population growth. Shrinking cities in post-industrial regions, Eastern Europe, and parts of East Asia face unique planning challenges that are not addressed by the urban growth literature's focus on rapidly expanding cities.

High-altitude cities, coastal cities, and cities in extreme climatic zones are underrepresented in the literature. Wang et al.'s study of Thimphu, Bhutan, represents a rare examination of urbanization in a high-altitude context [27]. Mumtaz et al.'s analysis of Karachi addressed coastal urbanization and flood risk [4]. However, systematic exploration of how environmental constraints and climate-related hazards influence urban growth patterns remains limited. Future research should examine urbanization in environmentally constrained contexts including coastal zones vulnerable to sea-level rise, arid regions with water scarcity, high-altitude areas with limited flat land, and regions prone to natural hazards.

**Temporal Limitations and Constraints**

The temporal depth of analyses varies considerably, with some studies examining only 10-15 years of change while others span 30-50 years [1], [4], [7], [15], [20], [21], [25]. Shorter time series limit the ability to calibrate dynamic models and may miss important long-term trends and cyclical patterns. The availability of historical satellite imagery constrains temporal depth, with Landsat data extending back to 1972 but with limited coverage and quality in early years. Future research should prioritize long-term analyses that capture multiple phases of urban development and enable assessment of how urbanization processes have evolved over time.

The temporal resolution of analyses typically employs decadal time steps, potentially missing important inter-decadal variations in urbanization rates [1], [7], [8], [15], [20], [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Annual or near-annual observations, as employed by O'Neill et al. [11], provide richer temporal information for model calibration and enable detection of rapid urbanization pulses. The increasing availability of high-temporal-resolution data from Sentinel-2 (5-day revisit) creates opportunities for more frequent monitoring, but this potential remains largely unexploited in urban growth modeling research.

The projection horizons employed in predictive studies vary from 10 years to 50 years, with longer horizons subject to greater uncertainty [1], [4], [8], [10], [15], [17], [20], [23], [27]. However, the relationship between projection horizon and prediction accuracy is rarely explicitly examined. Multi-temporal validation that assesses model performance at multiple future time points would provide insights into how accuracy degrades with increasing projection horizon, but such analyses are uncommon in the literature [20], [25].

**Data Availability and Quality Issues**

Despite the proliferation of freely available satellite data from Landsat and Sentinel missions, data availability remains a constraint in some regions and time periods. Cloud cover in tropical regions limits the availability of usable optical imagery, potentially introducing temporal gaps in time series analyses. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 offers all-weather observation capabilities, its utilization in urban growth research remains minimal. Future research should explore the integration of optical and SAR data to overcome cloud cover limitations and enhance temporal resolution.

The spatial resolution of freely available satellite data (30 meters for Landsat, 10 meters for Sentinel-2) constrains the detection of small urban patches and detailed intra-urban patterns [2], [15], [17]. Very high-resolution commercial satellite data (sub-meter to 5-meter resolution) could enable more detailed urban growth analysis but remains underutilized due to cost constraints and limited temporal archives. The increasing availability of high-resolution data from commercial providers and the emergence of new satellite constellations (e.g., Planet Labs) create opportunities for more detailed urban monitoring, but accessibility and cost remain barriers.

Reference data for training classification algorithms and validating model outputs represents another data challenge. Many studies rely on visual interpretation of satellite imagery or Google Earth for collecting training and validation samples [2], [6], [10], [15], [21], but the accuracy and representativeness of such samples are rarely rigorously assessed. Field surveys provide higher-quality reference data but are time-consuming and expensive, limiting their spatial and temporal coverage. The development of crowdsourced reference data collection approaches could help address this limitation but has received minimal attention in the urban growth literature.

Ancillary geospatial data including road networks, administrative boundaries, zoning regulations, and infrastructure locations are essential for urban growth modeling but are often unavailable or outdated in developing countries [10], [28]. The quality and completeness of such data directly influence model accuracy, yet data quality assessment is rarely explicitly addressed in the literature. Open data initiatives including OpenStreetMap provide valuable ancillary data but with variable quality and completeness across regions.

**Integration Challenges**

The integration of remote sensing-derived land cover information with GIS-based spatial analysis and dynamic modeling represents a core methodological challenge that is not always seamlessly achieved. Many studies employ separate software platforms for image classification (e.g., ENVI, ERDAS), GIS analysis (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS), and modeling (e.g., SLEUTH, MOLUSCE, TerrSet), requiring data format conversions and workflow coordination that can introduce errors and inefficiencies [1], [7], [8], [9], [14], [15], [21], [30]. Cloud-based platforms like Google Earth Engine that integrate data access, processing, and analysis represent a promising solution but are employed in only a subset of studies [2], [6], [12], [13].

The integration of urban growth modeling with broader sustainability assessments remains limited. While a few studies have linked land use change to urban heat island effects [13], flood risk [4], or Sustainable Development Goals [4], most research treats urban growth as an isolated phenomenon without explicitly connecting it to environmental, social, and economic outcomes. Future research should adopt more holistic frameworks that integrate urban growth modeling with assessments of ecosystem services, climate change impacts, public health outcomes, and social equity.

The translation of research findings into actionable planning recommendations represents a persistent gap. Many studies conclude with generic calls for "sustainable urban planning" or "informed policy-making" without providing specific, context-appropriate recommendations [1], [7], [9], [14], [15], [21], [26], [30]. The disconnect between academic research and planning practice limits the real-world impact of urban growth studies. Future research should engage more directly with planning practitioners and policymakers to ensure that methodologies and outputs are relevant to decision-making needs.

**Emerging Opportunities**

Despite these gaps, the literature reveals several promising directions for future research. The application of deep learning approaches including CNNs and LSTMs to urban growth prediction is in its early stages but shows considerable promise [5], [11], [19]. The integration of diverse data sources including nighttime lights, social media data, mobile phone data, and Internet of Things sensors could provide new insights into urbanization processes. The development of real-time or near-real-time urban monitoring systems leveraging high-temporal-resolution satellite data could enable more responsive planning interventions. The application of explainable AI techniques to deep learning models could help address the interpretability challenge. The integration of urban growth modeling with climate change scenarios and adaptation planning represents an urgent priority given the increasing climate risks facing cities globally.

In conclusion, while the field of spatio-temporal urban growth analysis using GIS and remote sensing has made remarkable progress, significant opportunities remain for methodological innovation, geographical expansion, temporal refinement, data enhancement, and improved integration with planning practice. Addressing these gaps will require interdisciplinary collaboration, sustained investment in Earth observation infrastructure, development of open-source tools and standardized protocols, and stronger engagement between researchers and practitioners.
