# CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Background to the Literature Review

The application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies to urban growth analysis has evolved significantly over the past four decades, transforming from basic land cover mapping to sophisticated predictive modeling of spatio-temporal urban dynamics. This literature review examines the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and empirical findings of urban growth studies, with particular emphasis on applications in Nigerian cities and developing countries between 2010 and 2025.

The evolution of remote sensing technology has been marked by substantial improvements in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Early urban studies in the 1980s relied primarily on Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data with 80-meter resolution, which provided basic land cover classification capabilities. The launch of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1984 represented a significant advancement, offering 30-meter spatial resolution across seven spectral bands, enabling more detailed urban feature extraction and change detection [1]. This technological leap facilitated comprehensive urban growth monitoring in African cities, as demonstrated by Okwuashi et al. (2021), who utilized Landsat-5 TM (1984), Landsat ETM+ (2000), and Landsat OLI (2015) data to analyze three decades of urban expansion in Lagos, Nigeria [1].

The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed the introduction of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) in 1999, which maintained 30-meter resolution for multispectral bands while adding a 15-meter panchromatic band for improved spatial detail. However, the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in 2003 created data gaps that necessitated gap-filling techniques and prompted researchers to explore alternative data sources [4]. The launch of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in 2013 marked another milestone, providing improved radiometric resolution (12-bit versus 8-bit) and additional spectral bands, particularly beneficial for urban feature discrimination and coastal zone mapping [6], [29].

Beyond Landsat, the remote sensing landscape has diversified considerably. The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 constellation, operational since 2015, offers 10-meter resolution multispectral imagery with a five-day revisit time, significantly enhancing temporal monitoring capabilities for rapid urban change detection [6]. High-resolution commercial satellites such as SPOT (Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre) with 2.5 to 10-meter resolution, and very high-resolution sensors like QuickBird, IKONOS, and WorldView series (sub-meter to 2-meter resolution) have enabled detailed urban morphology studies and infrastructure mapping [13], [28]. Additionally, radar-based systems such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have proven valuable for all-weather urban monitoring and settlement detection in cloud-prone tropical regions [27].

The methodological evolution in urban growth analysis has paralleled these technological advancements. Early studies in the 1990s employed basic post-classification change detection techniques, comparing classified land use/land cover (LULC) maps from different time periods to quantify urban expansion [7]. The 2000s saw the integration of more sophisticated classification algorithms, including supervised classification methods such as Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), which became the standard approach for LULC mapping [1], [4]. The introduction of machine learning algorithms in the 2010s revolutionized image classification accuracy. Support Vector Machines (SVM), introduced to remote sensing applications around 2005-2008, demonstrated superior performance in handling high-dimensional data and complex urban landscapes, achieving classification accuracies exceeding 90% in many studies [1], [4], [20].

The predictive modeling of urban growth has evolved from simple trend extrapolation to complex simulation models. The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) model, which gained prominence in urban studies during the mid-2000s, combines the spatial dynamics of cellular automata with the temporal transition probabilities of Markov chains, enabling realistic simulation of urban expansion patterns [2], [3], [6], [10], [18]. More recently, researchers have integrated machine learning algorithms with CA-Markov models to improve prediction accuracy. Okwuashi et al. (2021) demonstrated that combining SVM with CA-Markov achieved accuracies ranging from 79.07% to 88.86% for different time periods in Lagos [1]. Advanced neural network approaches, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), have shown promise in capturing non-linear relationships in urban growth processes [5], [21], [28].

The application of these technologies to Nigerian urban contexts has intensified since 2010, driven by rapid urbanization rates and the need for evidence-based urban planning. Nigeria's urbanization rate of approximately 4% per annum ranks among the highest in Africa, with cities like Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan, Kano, and Port Harcourt experiencing unprecedented spatial expansion [1], [4], [5], [6], [10]. Ibadan, the focus of this study, represents a particularly important case as one of Nigeria's largest cities and the capital of Oyo State. Studies by Oladele et al. (2011) and Taiwo (2021) have documented Ibadan's urban growth dynamics, revealing patterns of sprawl, peri-urban expansion, and land use transformation that characterize many West African cities [7], [15].

The theoretical frameworks underpinning urban growth analysis have also matured. Contemporary studies recognize urban expansion as a complex system influenced by multiple drivers including population growth, economic development, infrastructure provision, topography, proximity to roads and urban centers, land use policies, and socio-economic factors [1], [4], [8], [12]. The integration of spatial explanatory variables—such as distance to roads, distance to city center, elevation, slope, and population density—into predictive models has become standard practice, enabling more accurate simulation of future urban scenarios [1], [20].

Despite these advances, significant challenges remain in applying GIS and remote sensing to urban growth analysis in developing countries. Data availability and quality issues, limited ground truth data for validation, rapid and often informal settlement growth, cloud cover in tropical regions, and limited technical capacity continue to constrain research efforts [6], [10], [27]. Nevertheless, the period from 2010 to 2025 has witnessed remarkable progress in addressing these challenges through improved satellite data access (particularly through free Landsat and Sentinel archives), enhanced computational capabilities, development of cloud-based processing platforms like Google Earth Engine, and growing local expertise in African institutions [6], [27].

This literature review is structured thematically to provide comprehensive coverage of the field. Section 2.2 examines related literature organized by methodological approaches, study areas, and research outcomes. Section 2.3 synthesizes the literature, identifies research gaps, and establishes the rationale for the current study on Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan. Through this systematic review of 30 key studies published between 2010 and 2025, this chapter establishes the theoretical and methodological foundation for spatio-temporal analysis and prediction of urban growth in the study area.

## 2.2 Review of Related Literature

### 2.2.1 Method-Based Reviews

#### 2.2.1.1 Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) Models

The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) model has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches for simulating and predicting urban growth in developing countries. This hybrid model combines the spatial contiguity rules of cellular automata with the temporal transition probabilities of Markov chains, providing a powerful framework for modeling complex urban dynamics.

Koko et al. (2020) applied the CA-Markov model to monitor and predict spatio-temporal LULC changes in Zaria City, Nigeria, using satellite remote sensing data and GIS techniques [2], [18]. Their study forecasted urban growth, reforestation, and agricultural development over a 30-year period, demonstrating the model's capability to project multiple land use transitions simultaneously. The CA-Markov approach enabled the researchers to capture both the temporal probability of land use change and the spatial patterns of urban expansion, providing valuable insights for urban planning in medium-sized Nigerian cities.

Gilbert et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive study of Lagos City, Nigeria, integrating remote sensing urban monitoring indices with the CA-Markov model [3], [6]. Their methodology employed multi-temporal Landsat imagery to derive urban monitoring indices, which were then incorporated into the CA-Markov framework to enhance prediction accuracy. The study achieved high validation accuracy, demonstrating that the integration of spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Urban Index (UI) significantly improved the model's ability to capture urban growth patterns. The research projected Lagos's urban expansion to 2030, revealing continued sprawl into peri-urban areas and highlighting the need for sustainable urban planning interventions.

In Kano Metropolis, Koko et al. (2022) implemented a hybrid modeling approach combining CA-Markov with machine learning techniques for spatiotemporal LULC mapping and prediction from 2020 to 2050 [10]. Their study utilized multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1990, 2005, 2020) and employed Random Forest classification to generate accurate LULC maps with overall accuracies exceeding 85%. The CA-Markov model was then calibrated using these classified maps to simulate future urban scenarios. The results indicated that Kano's built-up area would increase by approximately 45% between 2020 and 2050, primarily at the expense of agricultural land and vegetation cover. This study exemplifies the trend toward integrating advanced classification algorithms with traditional CA-Markov models to improve prediction reliability.

Mahmoud et al. (2016) analyzed settlement expansion and urban growth in Abuja City, Nigeria, using the Land Change Modeler (LCM) embedded in IDRISI software, which implements a CA-Markov framework [4]. Their study employed Landsat imagery from 1986, 2001, and 2014, classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve overall accuracies of 82%, 92%, and 92% respectively. The error-adjusted area (EAA) method was applied for accuracy assessment, yielding more conservative estimates of 69%, 91%, and 91%. The LCM model projected LULC changes to 2050, revealing that urban areas increased by more than 11% between 1986 and 2001, and by 17% between 2001 and 2014. The study demonstrated the model's utility in assessing potential impacts of urbanization on climate and environmental conditions in rapidly growing African capitals.

Wang et al. (2018) investigated spatio-temporal urban growth dynamics of Lagos Metropolitan Region using hybrid methods for LULC modeling and prediction [5]. Their approach combined CA-Markov with logistic regression to identify driving factors of urban expansion. The study utilized Landsat TM and OLI imagery from 1984, 2000, and 2016, achieving classification accuracies above 88%. The hybrid model successfully predicted urban growth patterns for 2030, with validation results showing strong agreement between simulated and actual land use patterns (Kappa coefficient > 0.80). The research identified proximity to roads, distance to city center, and population density as the most significant drivers of urban expansion in Lagos.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2020) simulated urban land expansion in the Abuja City-Region using CA-Markov and logistic regression within the IDRISI Land Change Modeler framework [8]. Their study incorporated spatial explanatory variables including distance to roads, distance to urban centers, elevation, and slope to model urban growth drivers. The research utilized Landsat imagery from 1986, 2003, and 2016, with SVM classification achieving overall accuracies exceeding 85%. The CA-Markov model projected urban scenarios to 2030 and 2043, revealing that without intervention, urban areas would expand by approximately 60% by 2030. The study emphasized the importance of integrating land use planning policies into predictive models to guide sustainable urban development.

Onilude et al. (2020) employed GlobeLand30 data and a cellular automata model to analyze urban sprawl and predict growth in Lagos [13]. GlobeLand30, a global land cover dataset with 30-meter resolution, provided consistent LULC information for 2000 and 2010. The cellular automata model was calibrated using these datasets and validated against 2015 land cover data, achieving a Kappa coefficient of 0.78. The study projected Lagos's urban expansion to 2025, indicating a 35% increase in built-up area. This research demonstrated the utility of global land cover products for urban growth modeling in data-scarce environments, though it noted limitations in capturing informal settlements and small-scale urban features.

#### 2.2.1.2 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Approaches

The integration of machine learning algorithms into urban growth analysis has significantly enhanced classification accuracy and predictive capability. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and deep learning approaches have become increasingly prevalent in recent literature.

Okwuashi et al. (2021) pioneered the integration of machine learning with Markov chain and cellular automata models for urban land use change modeling in Lagos [1]. Their study employed SVM for both image classification and CA model calibration. Using Landsat-5 TM (1984), Landsat ETM+ (2000), and Landsat OLI (2015) data, they extracted twelve spatial independent variables through ArcGIS, including distance to roads, distance to urban centers, elevation, slope, and population density. The Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was used for initial LULC classification, followed by SVM-based CA calibration. The study achieved accuracies ranging from 79.07% to 86.07% for the 1984-2000 period and 83.20% to 88.86% for 2000-2015. Validation using McNemar's test, multi-linear regression, and ROC plots confirmed that all spatial explanatory variables were statistically significant, with computed AUCs showing substantial fit. The research demonstrated that 78.34% of urban cells remained urban between 1984-2000, while 21.33% of non-urban cells transitioned to urban, indicating persistent urban expansion patterns.

Okwuashi et al. (2012) earlier explored the application of Support Vector Machine-based GIS cellular automata for predicting future land use change in Lagos [20]. This study utilized topographic maps from 1963, 1978, and 1984, and Landsat ETM+ from 2000 as the base map. ArcGIS and MATLAB were employed for processing and visualization, with image classification performed using the k-means algorithm. The core modeling approach was a loosely coupled GIS-Cellular Automata model based on a non-parametric SVM model, employing linear, polynomial, and RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernels. Model performance evaluation using the Kappa statistic and ROC analysis revealed that the RBF kernel yielded the highest AUC estimate, followed by polynomial and linear kernels. The optimal SVM parameters were C (ln10e0, ln10e5, ln10e1 for 1963-1978), d=7, and γ=4 (for 1963-1978 and 1978-1984), and γ=2 (for 1984-2000). The model successfully predicted urban forms in Lagos for 2015 and 2030, establishing SVM-based GIS cellular automata as a promising tool for land use change prediction in developing countries.

Badshah et al. (2024) investigated the role of Random Forest and Markov chain models in understanding metropolitan urban growth trajectory [24]. Their study compared the performance of Random Forest classification with traditional methods and integrated RF with Markov chains for temporal prediction. The Random Forest algorithm demonstrated superior classification accuracy (overall accuracy > 92%) compared to Maximum Likelihood and other parametric classifiers, particularly in distinguishing between urban and peri-urban land cover types. The integration of RF with Markov chains provided robust predictions of urban growth trajectories, with the model successfully capturing non-linear relationships between urban expansion and driving factors. The study emphasized that ensemble learning methods like Random Forest are particularly effective in handling the complexity and heterogeneity of urban landscapes in developing countries.

Ozturk (2015) compared cellular automata-Markov chain and Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC) models for urban growth simulation in Atakum, Turkey [28]. The study utilized Landsat TM imagery from 1989 and 2000 to simulate urban growth for 2013, which was then validated against actual 2013 LULC data. The MLP-MC method provided superior results according to the Kappa index of agreement, achieving a Kappa coefficient of 0.84 compared to 0.76 for CA-Markov. Based on these validation results, the MLP-MC model was used to simulate urban growth for 2025, estimating an urban growth rate of 35.2% between 2013 and 2025, with built-up area increasing from 16,819 ha to 22,743 ha. The study demonstrated that MLP-based models, which can capture non-linear relationships and complex spatial patterns, often outperform traditional CA-Markov approaches, particularly in areas with irregular urban growth patterns.

Onatayo et al. (2022) employed a geospatial and neural network approach to analyze urban growth dynamics in Southwest Nigeria [21]. Their study integrated Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with GIS to model urban expansion patterns across multiple cities in the region. The ANN model was trained using historical urban growth data and spatial variables, achieving prediction accuracies exceeding 85%. The research demonstrated that neural network approaches can effectively capture the complex, non-linear relationships between urban growth and its drivers, including socio-economic factors, infrastructure development, and environmental constraints. The study highlighted the potential of AI-based approaches for regional urban growth modeling in West Africa.

#### 2.2.1.3 Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection and Classification Techniques

Accurate LULC classification forms the foundation of urban growth analysis. The evolution of classification techniques from traditional supervised methods to advanced machine learning algorithms has significantly improved the reliability of urban change detection studies.

Oladele et al. (2011) conducted one of the early comprehensive studies on dynamics of urban land use changes in Ibadan, Nigeria, using remote sensing [7]. Their study employed Landsat imagery to map and analyze LULC changes over multiple decades. The research utilized supervised classification techniques to identify major land cover classes including built-up areas, vegetation, water bodies, and bare land. Post-classification change detection revealed significant urban expansion in Ibadan, with built-up areas increasing at the expense of agricultural land and natural vegetation. The study established baseline information on Ibadan's urban growth patterns, providing crucial context for subsequent research in the area.

Taiwo (2021) modeled the spatiotemporal patterns of urban sprawl in Ibadan metropolis between 1984 and 2013 [15]. The study employed Landsat TM and OLI imagery, utilizing supervised classification with Maximum Likelihood Classifier to generate LULC maps. The research achieved overall classification accuracies ranging from 82% to 89% across different time periods. Post-classification change detection analysis revealed that Ibadan's built-up area expanded by approximately 156% between 1984 and 2013, with urban sprawl occurring primarily along major transportation corridors and in peri-urban zones. The study employed spatial metrics including landscape fragmentation indices, patch density, and edge density to characterize urban sprawl patterns. The findings indicated that Ibadan's urban growth exhibited characteristics of both compact development in the core and dispersed sprawl in peripheral areas, reflecting the complex interplay of formal and informal urban development processes.

Adedeji et al. (2020) conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of urban sprawl and LULC changes in a suburb of Lagos and Ogun metropolises, Nigeria, covering the period 1986-2014 [29]. The study utilized Landsat TM (1984, 2000) and Landsat OLI (2014) imagery to assess urban expansion patterns. Five broad LULC classes were identified and mapped: built-up area, bare ground, water body, thick forest, and light forest. The classification revealed that thick forest had the largest coverage of 8,537.72 hectares (67.52%) in 1984, while built-up area occupied only 1,075.99 hectares (8.51%). Between 1984 and 2014, built-up areas gained 6,423.38 hectares (59.31% increase), while thick forest cover lost 8,612.09 hectares. Post-classification change analysis demonstrated that thick and light forest types experienced the highest net losses due to conversion to built-up areas. The study concluded that urbanization and subsequent urban sprawl were major factors of land degradation, leading to rapid losses of non-urban land uses, especially in urban fringes.

Gambo et al. (2021) monitored three decades of urban growth in Hadejia, Nigeria, using remote sensing and geospatial techniques [30]. The study acquired satellite data for 1984, 1999, and 2019, which were atmospherically corrected using QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction) in ENVI software. The research employed Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for image classification, representing a methodological advancement over traditional pixel-based approaches. OBIA considers spatial context, shape, texture, and spectral properties of image objects, making it particularly effective for urban feature extraction. Built-up areas were extracted to evaluate urban expansion, revealing that the most significant growth occurred between 1999 and 2019, with an expansion of 566 hectares. The study found that most changes occurred along major highways, especially interstate routes, with extreme growth in the East-Northern part due to plain terrain, while Southern expansion was constrained by the Hadejia River.

Onwuka et al. (2017) employed a sub-pixel approach for geospatial modeling and prediction of LULC dynamics in Onitsha Metropolis, Nigeria [9]. Sub-pixel classification techniques, also known as spectral unmixing, address the mixed pixel problem common in medium-resolution satellite imagery, where individual pixels may contain multiple land cover types. The study utilized Landsat imagery and applied linear spectral unmixing to estimate the fractional abundance of different land cover types within each pixel. This approach provided more accurate estimates of urban area, particularly for detecting gradual urban expansion and peri-urban development. The research demonstrated that sub-pixel methods could improve LULC classification accuracy by 10-15% compared to traditional hard classification approaches, especially in heterogeneous urban-rural transition zones.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2019) integrated GIS and remotely sensed data to support land use planning in the Abuja City-Region [27]. Their study employed multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1986, 2003, 2016) and utilized Support Vector Machine classification to generate accurate LULC maps with overall accuracies exceeding 85%. The research incorporated ancillary data including digital elevation models, road networks, and administrative boundaries to enhance classification accuracy and provide context for urban growth analysis. The study demonstrated that integrating multiple data sources and advanced classification algorithms significantly improved the reliability of LULC mapping in rapidly urbanizing regions. The research also emphasized the importance of accuracy assessment using both pixel-based and area-based methods, with the error-adjusted area approach providing more realistic estimates of land cover proportions.

#### 2.2.1.4 Spatial Drivers and Explanatory Variables in Urban Growth Modeling

Understanding the factors that drive urban expansion is crucial for developing accurate predictive models and informing urban planning policies. Recent studies have increasingly incorporated spatial explanatory variables into urban growth models to capture the complex relationships between urban expansion and its drivers.

Otuoze et al. (2020) conducted predictive modeling of transport infrastructure space for urban growth phenomena in Kano, Nigeria [11], [12]. Their study specifically focused on the role of transportation networks as a primary driver of urban expansion. The research employed GIS-based spatial analysis to quantify the relationship between road network development and urban growth patterns. Using multi-temporal satellite imagery and road network data, the study demonstrated that proximity to major roads was the strongest predictor of urban expansion, with 68% of new urban development occurring within 500 meters of existing roads. The research employed logistic regression to model the probability of urban development as a function of distance to roads, distance to city center, and other spatial variables. The findings emphasized the critical role of transport infrastructure planning in shaping urban growth trajectories in developing countries.

Otuoze et al. (2021) extended this work by monitoring spatial-temporal transition dynamics of transport infrastructure space in urban growth phenomena in Lagos, Nigeria [25]. The study employed a comprehensive set of spatial variables including road density, accessibility indices, distance to major highways, distance to ports and airports, and public transportation coverage. The research utilized spatial regression models to quantify the influence of each variable on urban expansion patterns. The results revealed that areas with high road density and good accessibility experienced urban growth rates 3-4 times higher than poorly connected areas. The study also identified feedback loops between urban growth and infrastructure development, where initial urban expansion stimulated infrastructure investment, which in turn attracted further urban development.

Ahmed et al. (2024) investigated urban growth and urban heat island effects in Kano Metropolis using a remotely sensed approach [14]. While primarily focused on environmental impacts, the study incorporated spatial drivers of urban growth including elevation, slope, land surface temperature, and vegetation indices. The research demonstrated that topographic factors significantly influenced urban expansion patterns, with flat areas experiencing more rapid development than sloped terrain. The study also revealed that urban growth was negatively correlated with vegetation density and positively correlated with land surface temperature, highlighting the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

Idi et al. (2016) explored predictive land use modeling as a tool for regulating urban development in Yola, Nigeria [16]. Their study incorporated a comprehensive set of spatial explanatory variables including socio-economic factors (population density, income levels), physical factors (elevation, slope, soil type), accessibility factors (distance to roads, distance to markets, distance to schools), and policy factors (zoning regulations, land tenure). The research employed multi-criteria evaluation and weighted overlay analysis in GIS to identify areas with high urban development potential. The study demonstrated that integrating multiple categories of explanatory variables significantly improved model performance, with the combined model achieving 82% accuracy in predicting urban expansion patterns.

### 2.2.2 Study Area-Based Reviews

#### 2.2.2.1 Ibadan-Specific Studies

Ibadan, as one of Nigeria's largest cities and the capital of Oyo State, has been the subject of several important urban growth studies. The city's historical significance, rapid population growth, and complex urban morphology make it an ideal case study for understanding urbanization processes in West Africa.

Oladele et al. (2011) provided foundational research on the dynamics of urban land use changes in Ibadan using remote sensing [7]. This early study established baseline information on Ibadan's urban expansion patterns, documenting the city's growth from a traditional Yoruba settlement to a major metropolitan area. The research employed multi-temporal satellite imagery to map LULC changes, revealing significant conversion of agricultural land and natural vegetation to urban uses. The study identified major growth corridors along the Ibadan-Lagos expressway and other major roads, establishing patterns that have continued in subsequent years. This research provided crucial historical context for understanding Ibadan's urban development trajectory.

Taiwo (2021) conducted a more recent and comprehensive analysis, modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of urban sprawl in Ibadan metropolis between 1984 and 2013 [15]. The study employed advanced spatial metrics and landscape ecology approaches to characterize urban sprawl patterns. The research revealed that Ibadan's built-up area expanded by approximately 156% over the 29-year period, with an average annual growth rate of 5.4%. The study identified three distinct phases of urban growth: compact infill development in the city core (1984-1995), rapid peripheral expansion (1995-2005), and dispersed sprawl in peri-urban areas (2005-2013). The research employed spatial metrics including patch density, edge density, landscape shape index, and aggregation index to quantify urban sprawl characteristics. The findings indicated increasing fragmentation of the urban landscape, with implications for infrastructure provision, service delivery, and environmental sustainability. The study emphasized the need for integrated urban planning approaches to manage Ibadan's continued expansion.

While these studies provide valuable insights into Ibadan's overall urban growth, there remains a significant gap in detailed analysis of specific local government areas within the metropolis. Akinyele Local Government, located in the northern part of Ibadan, has experienced particularly rapid growth in recent years due to its proximity to major institutions, road networks, and availability of land for development. However, no comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis focusing specifically on Akinyele has been published, representing a critical gap that the current study addresses.

#### 2.2.2.2 Lagos Metropolitan Region Studies

Lagos, as Nigeria's largest city and economic hub, has received extensive attention in urban growth literature. The city's rapid expansion, complex governance structure, and significant economic importance make it a focal point for urban research in West Africa.

Okwuashi et al. (2021) integrated machine learning with Markov chain and cellular automata models to analyze urban land use change in Lagos [1]. Their comprehensive study covered three decades (1984-2015) and projected urban growth to 2030. The research revealed that Lagos's built-up area increased from approximately 15% of the total area in 1984 to 45% in 2015, representing a threefold expansion. The study identified persistent urban expansion patterns, with 78.34% of urban cells remaining urban between 1984-2000, and 84.69% between 2000-2015, indicating the permanence of urban development. The research also documented the conversion of 21.33% of non-urban cells to urban between 1984-2000, and 24.29% between 2000-2015, demonstrating accelerating urban expansion rates.

Wang et al. (2018) investigated spatio-temporal urban growth dynamics of Lagos Metropolitan Region using hybrid methods [5]. Their study achieved classification accuracies above 88% and successfully predicted urban growth patterns for 2030. The research identified proximity to roads, distance to city center, and population density as the most significant drivers of urban expansion. The study revealed that Lagos's urban area expanded from 631 km² in 1984 to 1,183 km² in 2016, representing an 87% increase. The research projected that by 2030, Lagos's urban area would reach approximately 1,650 km², requiring significant infrastructure investment and urban planning interventions.

Gilbert et al. (2023) employed remote sensing urban monitoring indices integrated with CA-Markov model for Lagos City [3], [6]. Their study utilized spectral indices including NDBI, NDVI, and UI to enhance urban feature detection and improve prediction accuracy. The research achieved high validation accuracy and projected Lagos's continued sprawl into peri-urban areas through 2030. The study emphasized the environmental consequences of rapid urban expansion, including loss of agricultural land, deforestation, and increased surface temperatures.

Eyoh et al. (2012) modeled and predicted future urban expansion of Lagos using logistic regression and GIS [19]. This earlier study established methodological foundations for subsequent research, demonstrating the utility of logistic regression for identifying urban growth drivers and predicting expansion patterns. The research incorporated spatial variables including distance to roads, distance to city center, elevation, and population density, achieving prediction accuracies of approximately 78%.

Okwuashi et al. (2012) predicted future land use change in Lagos using Support Vector Machine-based GIS cellular automata [20]. This pioneering study demonstrated the superiority of SVM-based approaches over traditional methods, with the RBF kernel achieving the highest prediction accuracy. The research successfully predicted urban forms for 2015 and 2030, establishing SVM-based cellular automata as a robust tool for urban growth modeling.

Adedeji et al. (2020) analyzed urban sprawl and LULC changes in a suburb of Lagos and Ogun metropolises from 1986-2014 [29]. The study documented a 59.31% increase in built-up areas and an 8,612.09 hectare loss of thick forest cover, highlighting the environmental costs of urban expansion. The research emphasized that urbanization and urban sprawl were major factors of land degradation in urban fringes.

Otuoze et al. (2021) monitored spatial-temporal transition dynamics of transport infrastructure space in Lagos [25]. The study revealed that areas with high road density experienced urban growth rates 3-4 times higher than poorly connected areas, emphasizing the critical role of transportation infrastructure in shaping urban expansion patterns.

Os et al. (2016) conducted change detection analysis of land surface temperature and LULC over Lagos Metropolis [22]. The study documented the urban heat island effect associated with rapid urban expansion, revealing that built-up areas experienced temperatures 3-5°C higher than surrounding vegetated areas. The research highlighted the environmental and public health implications of unplanned urban growth.

#### 2.2.2.3 Other Nigerian Cities

Beyond Lagos and Ibadan, several other Nigerian cities have been subjects of urban growth studies, providing comparative insights into urbanization processes across different geographic and socio-economic contexts.

Mahmoud et al. (2016) analyzed settlement expansion and urban growth in Abuja City, Nigeria's federal capital [4], [17]. Their study revealed that urban areas increased by more than 11% between 1986 and 2001, and by 17% between 2001 and 2014, demonstrating accelerating urban growth rates. The research employed SVM classification achieving overall accuracies of 82%, 92%, and 92% for 1986, 2001, and 2014 respectively. The LCM model projected LULC changes to 2050, revealing continued urban expansion and potential impacts on climate and environmental conditions. The study emphasized the challenges of managing rapid urban growth in a planned capital city, where formal planning frameworks exist but are often overwhelmed by the pace of development.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2020) simulated urban land expansion in the Abuja City-Region [8]. Their research projected that without intervention, urban areas would expand by approximately 60% by 2030. The study incorporated spatial explanatory variables including distance to roads, distance to urban centers, elevation, and slope, achieving overall accuracies exceeding 85%. The research emphasized the importance of integrating land use planning policies into predictive models to guide sustainable urban development.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2019) integrated GIS and remotely sensed data to support land use planning in the Abuja City-Region [27]. The study employed multi-temporal Landsat imagery and SVM classification to generate accurate LULC maps. The research demonstrated that integrating multiple data sources and advanced classification algorithms significantly improved the reliability of LULC mapping in rapidly urbanizing regions.

Koko et al. (2020) monitored and predicted spatio-temporal LULC changes in Zaria City, Nigeria, using CA-Markov model [2], [18]. Their study forecasted urban growth, reforestation, and agricultural development over a 30-year period. The research demonstrated the model's capability to project multiple land use transitions simultaneously, providing valuable insights for urban planning in medium-sized Nigerian cities.

Koko et al. (2022) conducted spatiotemporal LULC mapping and prediction in Kano Metropolis from 2020-2050 [10]. Their hybrid modeling approach combined CA-Markov with Random Forest classification, achieving overall accuracies exceeding 85%. The results indicated that Kano's built-up area would increase by approximately 45% between 2020 and 2050, primarily at the expense of agricultural land and vegetation cover.

Otuoze et al. (2020) conducted predictive modeling of transport infrastructure space for urban growth in Kano [11], [12]. The study demonstrated that proximity to major roads was the strongest predictor of urban expansion, with 68% of new urban development occurring within 500 meters of existing roads.

Ahmed et al. (2024) investigated urban growth and urban heat island effects in Kano Metropolis [14]. The research demonstrated that topographic factors significantly influenced urban expansion patterns, with flat areas experiencing more rapid development than sloped terrain.

Onwuka et al. (2017) employed a sub-pixel approach for geospatial modeling of LULC dynamics in Onitsha Metropolis [9]. The study demonstrated that sub-pixel methods could improve LULC classification accuracy by 10-15% compared to traditional hard classification approaches.

Idi et al. (2016) explored predictive land use modeling in Yola, Nigeria [16]. The study incorporated socio-economic, physical, accessibility, and policy factors, achieving 82% accuracy in predicting urban expansion patterns.

Gambo et al. (2021) monitored three decades of urban growth in Hadejia, Nigeria [30]. The study employed Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for classification, revealing that the most significant growth occurred between 1999 and 2019, with an expansion of 566 hectares along major highways.

Aliyu et al. (2024) examined patterns and trends of change in Greater Yola, Adamawa State, over a 10-year period [26]. The study provided recent insights into urban growth dynamics in northeastern Nigeria, a region that has received less attention in urban growth literature.

Yakubu et al. (2018) assessed spatial variation of land surface characteristics in Minna, Niger State, for sustainable urbanization using geospatial techniques [23]. The study emphasized the importance of understanding local environmental conditions in urban planning and development.

#### 2.2.2.4 Comparative and Regional Studies

Several studies have adopted comparative or regional approaches, examining urban growth patterns across multiple cities or broader geographic areas to identify common trends and context-specific variations.

Onatayo et al. (2022) employed a geospatial and neural network approach to analyze urban growth dynamics in Southwest Nigeria [21]. Their regional study integrated data from multiple cities including Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, and Akure, revealing common patterns of urban expansion along major transportation corridors and variations related to local economic activities and topography. The research demonstrated that neural network approaches can effectively capture complex, non-linear relationships between urban growth and its drivers across different urban contexts.

The comparative analysis of Nigerian cities reveals several common characteristics: (1) rapid urban expansion rates averaging 4-6% annually, (2) predominant growth along major transportation corridors, (3) significant loss of agricultural land and natural vegetation, (4) challenges in formal planning and regulation, (5) increasing urban sprawl and fragmentation, and (6) environmental consequences including urban heat islands and loss of ecosystem services. However, context-specific variations exist related to city size, economic base, topography, governance structures, and historical development patterns.

### 2.2.3 Outcome-Based Reviews

#### 2.2.3.1 Urban Sprawl Patterns and Characteristics

Urban sprawl, characterized by low-density, dispersed development extending into rural areas, has emerged as a dominant pattern of urban growth in Nigerian cities. Understanding sprawl patterns is crucial for developing effective urban management strategies.

Taiwo (2021) provided detailed analysis of urban sprawl patterns in Ibadan metropolis between 1984 and 2013 [15]. The study employed spatial metrics including patch density, edge density, landscape shape index, and aggregation index to quantify sprawl characteristics. The research revealed increasing fragmentation of the urban landscape, with patch density increasing from 2.3 patches per km² in 1984 to 5.7 patches per km² in 2013. Edge density, measuring the amount of edge per unit area, increased from 45 m/ha to 112 m/ha over the same period, indicating more irregular and fragmented urban forms. The landscape shape index, which measures the complexity of patch shapes, increased from 1.8 to 3.2, suggesting increasingly irregular urban boundaries. These metrics collectively indicated a transition from compact urban development to dispersed sprawl, with implications for infrastructure costs, service delivery efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Adedeji et al. (2020) analyzed urban sprawl in a suburb of Lagos and Ogun metropolises from 1986-2014 [29]. The study documented a 59.31% increase in built-up areas, primarily through conversion of forest and agricultural land. The research revealed that sprawl was particularly pronounced in urban fringes, where land was more affordable and regulatory enforcement was weaker. The study identified urbanization and subsequent urban sprawl as major factors of land degradation, leading to rapid losses of non-urban land uses.

Gilbert et al. (2023) projected Lagos's continued sprawl into peri-urban areas through 2030 [3], [6]. The research emphasized that without intervention, sprawl would continue to consume agricultural land and natural areas, threatening food security and environmental sustainability. The study recommended policies to promote compact development, mixed land use, and preservation of green spaces.

#### 2.2.3.2 Urban Growth Predictions and Future Scenarios

Predictive modeling of urban growth provides crucial information for proactive urban planning and policy development. Recent studies have projected urban growth scenarios for Nigerian cities, revealing the scale of future urbanization challenges.

Okwuashi et al. (2021) projected Lagos's urban growth to 2030, revealing continued expansion of built-up areas [1]. The study predicted that urban areas would increase from 45% of the total area in 2015 to approximately 58% by 2030, requiring significant infrastructure investment and urban planning interventions.

Wang et al. (2018) projected that Lagos's urban area would reach approximately 1,650 km² by 2030, representing a 40% increase from 2016 levels [5]. The research emphasized the need for integrated urban planning approaches to manage this expansion sustainably.

Koko et al. (2022) predicted that Kano's built-up area would increase by approximately 45% between 2020 and 2050 [10]. The study projected that this expansion would occur primarily at the expense of agricultural land (65% of converted land) and vegetation cover (30% of converted land), with significant implications for food security and environmental sustainability.

Mahmoud et al. (2016) projected LULC changes in Abuja to 2050, revealing continued urban expansion and potential impacts on climate and environmental conditions [4]. The study predicted that urban areas would increase from 17% of the total area in 2014 to approximately 35% by 2050, doubling the urban footprint.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2020) projected that Abuja's urban areas would expand by approximately 60% by 2030 without intervention [8]. The research emphasized the importance of integrating land use planning policies into predictive models to guide sustainable urban development.

Ozturk (2015) estimated an urban growth rate of 35.2% between 2013 and 2025 in Atakum, Turkey, with built-up area increasing from 16,819 ha to 22,743 ha [28]. The study predicted the destruction of 5,117 ha of agricultural land and 44 ha of forest, highlighting the environmental costs of urban expansion.

These predictions collectively indicate that Nigerian cities face unprecedented urbanization challenges in the coming decades. Without proactive planning and policy interventions, urban expansion will continue to consume agricultural land and natural areas, exacerbate infrastructure deficits, and threaten environmental sustainability.

#### 2.2.3.3 Policy Implications and Planning Recommendations

The literature consistently emphasizes the need for evidence-based urban planning policies informed by spatial analysis and predictive modeling. Several studies have articulated specific policy recommendations based on their findings.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2020) emphasized the importance of integrating land use planning policies into predictive models to guide sustainable urban development in Abuja [8]. The study recommended: (1) establishment of urban growth boundaries to contain sprawl, (2) promotion of compact, mixed-use development, (3) preservation of agricultural land and green spaces, (4) investment in public transportation to reduce automobile dependence, and (5) strengthening of land use regulations and enforcement mechanisms.

Enoguanbhor et al. (2019) demonstrated how GIS and remotely sensed data can support land use planning in the Abuja City-Region [27]. The research emphasized the need for: (1) regular monitoring of urban growth using satellite imagery, (2) integration of spatial data into planning decision-making processes, (3) participatory planning approaches involving multiple stakeholders, and (4) coordination between different levels of government.

Otuoze et al. (2020) highlighted the critical role of transport infrastructure planning in shaping urban growth trajectories in Kano [11], [12]. The study recommended: (1) strategic planning of road networks to guide urban development, (2) integration of land use and transportation planning, (3) investment in public transportation infrastructure, and (4) regulation of development along major transportation corridors.

Taiwo (2021) emphasized the need for integrated urban planning approaches to manage Ibadan's continued expansion [15]. The study recommended: (1) development of a comprehensive metropolitan plan, (2) coordination between different local government areas, (3) promotion of infill development and urban regeneration, (4) preservation of green spaces and ecological corridors, and (5) investment in infrastructure to support planned growth areas.

Gilbert et al. (2023) recommended policies to promote compact development, mixed land use, and preservation of green spaces in Lagos [3], [6]. The study emphasized the need for: (1) revision of zoning regulations to promote higher density development, (2) incentives for infill development and brownfield redevelopment, (3) establishment of urban growth boundaries, and (4) investment in green infrastructure.

These policy recommendations share common themes: the need for proactive planning, integration of spatial data and analysis into decision-making, coordination across government levels and sectors, promotion of compact development, preservation of agricultural land and green spaces, investment in infrastructure, and strengthening of regulatory frameworks. Implementation of these recommendations requires political will, institutional capacity, financial resources, and sustained commitment to sustainable urban development.

### 2.3.2 Identified Research Gaps

The comprehensive review of literature reveals several critical research gaps that the current study on Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan, addresses:

**1. Geographic Coverage Gap**

While Lagos and Abuja have received extensive research attention, other major Nigerian cities including Ibadan have been understudied. Specifically, no comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis focusing on Akinyele Local Government has been published. Existing Ibadan studies (Oladele et al., 2011; Taiwo, 2021) focus on the entire metropolis without detailed analysis of specific local government areas [7], [15]. Akinyele, located in northern Ibadan, has experienced particularly rapid growth due to its proximity to major institutions, road networks, and availability of land for development, yet this growth remains poorly documented and analyzed.

**2. Temporal Coverage Gap**

Most existing studies end their analysis between 2013 and 2020, with limited research covering the 2020-2025 period. Taiwo's (2021) comprehensive Ibadan study ends at 2013, leaving a 12-year gap to the present [15]. The current study addresses this gap by analyzing urban growth from 2010 to 2025, providing up-to-date information on recent urbanization trends and enabling more accurate future projections.

**3. Methodological Integration Gap**

While several studies have employed either CA-Markov models or machine learning algorithms, few have comprehensively integrated multiple advanced techniques. The current study addresses this gap by combining state-of-the-art classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest), CA-Markov predictive modeling, and comprehensive spatial driver analysis within a single integrated framework.

**4. Spatial Resolution and Data Source Gap**

Most Nigerian urban growth studies rely exclusively on Landsat data (30-meter resolution). Few studies have integrated higher resolution data sources such as Sentinel-2 (10-meter resolution) or explored the potential of combining multiple satellite data sources. The current study addresses this gap by utilizing both Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery to improve classification accuracy and urban feature detection.

**5. Driver Analysis Gap**

While many studies identify general drivers of urban growth (proximity to roads, distance to city center), few provide detailed, context-specific analysis of driver interactions and relative importance in specific local contexts. The current study addresses this gap through comprehensive spatial analysis of multiple driver categories (physical, accessibility, socio-economic, policy) specific to Akinyele Local Government.

**6. Policy Scenario Gap**

Most studies project future urban growth based on historical trends without exploring alternative policy scenarios. Few studies have modeled the potential impacts of different planning interventions on urban growth trajectories. The current study addresses this gap by developing multiple future scenarios including business-as-usual, planned growth, and sustainable development scenarios.

**7. Validation and Accuracy Assessment Gap**

Many studies employ basic accuracy assessment methods without comprehensive validation using multiple approaches. The current study addresses this gap by employing multiple validation techniques including pixel-based accuracy assessment, area-based accuracy assessment, spatial agreement metrics, and temporal validation.

**8. Local Government Planning Gap**

Existing studies typically focus on entire metropolitan areas or states, providing limited actionable information for local government planning authorities. The current study addresses this gap by focusing specifically on Akinyele Local Government, providing detailed spatial information at a scale directly relevant to local planning decisions.

**9. Recent Technology Gap**

Few studies have leveraged recent advances in cloud-based processing platforms (Google Earth Engine), deep learning algorithms, and big data analytics for urban growth analysis in Nigerian contexts. The current study addresses this gap by employing contemporary computational approaches and tools.

**10. Integration of Informal Settlement Gap**

Most studies struggle to accurately detect and model informal settlements, which constitute a significant proportion of urban growth in Nigerian cities. The current study addresses this gap through high-resolution imagery analysis and field validation to improve informal settlement detection and characterization.

### 2.3.3 Contribution of Current Study

The current study on "Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Prediction of Urban Growth Using GIS and Remote Sensing: Case Study of Akinyele Local Government, Ibadan (2010-2025)" makes several important contributions to the literature:

1. **Geographic Contribution**: Provides the first comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth in Akinyele Local Government, filling a critical geographic gap in Ibadan urban studies.

2. **Temporal Contribution**: Extends the temporal coverage of Ibadan urban growth analysis from 2010 to 2025, providing up-to-date information on recent urbanization trends.

3. **Methodological Contribution**: Integrates multiple advanced techniques including machine learning classification (SVM, Random Forest), CA-Markov predictive modeling, comprehensive spatial driver analysis, and multiple validation approaches within a single framework.

4. **Data Contribution**: Utilizes both Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery to improve classification accuracy and urban feature detection, demonstrating the value of multi-source satellite data integration.

5. **Analytical Contribution**: Provides detailed, context-specific analysis of urban growth drivers and their interactions in Akinyele Local Government, enhancing understanding of local urbanization processes.

6. **Predictive Contribution**: Develops multiple future scenarios (business-as-usual, planned growth, sustainable development) to inform policy decisions and planning interventions.

7. **Practical Contribution**: Provides actionable spatial information at a scale directly relevant to local government planning authorities, supporting evidence-based urban management.

8. **Theoretical Contribution**: Enhances understanding of urban growth processes in medium-sized local government areas within larger metropolitan regions in developing countries.

9. **Technological Contribution**: Demonstrates the application of contemporary computational approaches and tools to urban growth analysis in Nigerian contexts.

10. **Policy Contribution**: Provides evidence-based recommendations for sustainable urban development in Akinyele Local Government, with broader applicability to similar contexts in Nigeria and West Africa.

By addressing these research gaps and making these contributions, the current study advances both theoretical understanding and practical application of GIS and remote sensing technologies for urban growth analysis and planning in Nigerian cities. The findings will provide valuable information for urban planners, policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders concerned with managing rapid urbanization in Akinyele Local Government and similar contexts.
